- optimizations

    - test: the transaction call from another transaction call lifting method optimization

    - test: different situations for the transactionalmethod->transactionalmethod call. 

    - GET_FIELD for tranlocal should use the tranlocal field

    - PUT_FIELD for the tranlocal should use the tranlocal field

    - when a loadForWrite is done, a check needs to be done if the current tranlocal is committed. If it is, it
    should be replaced by the updatable version.

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor_miscTest

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor_setCorePoolSizeTest

- test for the writeskew problem; activation disabled

- better message when there are too many failures.. atm it is unclear (write conflict? lock conflict?)

    - add to donor logic

    - add to transaction template

- writeskew detection tests

    - tinyupdatealphatransaction

---------------------------------------------------------------
todo unclear
---------------------------------------------------------------

- tests that use different transaction size to cause all transaction implementations to be used

- rethink about the or-else. There is no need to create a snapshot, but it can be used for nested transactions.

    - FixedTrackingUpdateAlphaTransaction and support for 'orelse'

     - TinyTrackingUpdateTransaction and support for orelse

     - TinyTrackingReadonlyTransaction and support for orelse

     - GrowingTrackingReadonlyTransaction and support for orelse


- make sure (using bug shaker) that the registration of the listener contains no
concurrency problem. I think it is possible that there are pending

- class hierarchy of recoverableexceptions is strange (retry and transactiontoosmall are recoverable but don't
implement this interface)

- debug information for the atomic object is lost somehow:
org.multiverse.api.exceptions.ReadonlyException
	at org.multiverse.stms.alpha.transactions.readonly.NonTrackingReadonlyAlphaTransaction.doAbortAndRegisterRetryLatch(NonTrackingReadonlyAlphaTransaction.java:166)

- logging

    - logging should be re-enabled but not with a subclass

    - logging configurable through annotations?

- support subclassing in instrumentation

    - tranlocal snapshot needs to be fixed for subclassing.

- logging on transactions should be configurable

---------------------------------------------------------------
todo features
---------------------------------------------------------------

- timeout op de transaction through annotations

- locking

    - transaction with only fresh objects doesnt need to increase the version, or
    lock/unlock.

- profiler

    - profiler should be added to the abstract transaction config

    - profiler statements of the abstract transaction should be added.

- retry policy should be configurable through annotation

- blocking executor.

- inlining of transactions

- when instrumentation fails, instead of continuing with the process, reinstrument the classes so that
 they always throw an error. Remove all fields/methods?

- GlobalStmInstance test

- performance test with readonly and update transaction that only do reads.

- todo:
   measure avarage locking tim with and without this (late wakening).

- bug shaker inbouwen

- work with a debug flag the enables exception reuse generally?

- a transaction that only does no updates but insert instead: does this transactionneed to increase
the clock?

- history for stale objects

- dynamic history length for history; start with a zero history and once there is a loadtoooldversion,
start maintaining history. Increase the history as long as you get loadtoooldversions.

- customizable contention managers

- pessimistic online locking

- nested transactions

- SkipList

- Tree

- Growing Array List

- via een system property aangeven welke mixin gebruikt moet worden

- het inlezen van de mixin hoeft niet iedere keer te gebeuren, maar
  kan eenmalig gedaan worden.

    - problem: the classnode of the mixin is modified atm, so can't be reused. This modification
    should be removed, or it is not possible to reuse the classnode and it needs to be read again and again

- more complex cycle test with collections that have references to each other.

- a selector for transactions to make non blocking transaction processing possible, using more transactions
than threads. Just like non blocking io.

- on instance level control on the length of history; if load fails because no history can be found, \
increase the length of the history to main and retry the transaction.

- propagation support

- a better way to run the tests of the stm dependant packages in the core package. Atm
they are moved to the alpha package, so they have an stm to be tested against.

- when a field access is done without a transaction, throw an error that contains the class/field

- exceptions thrown in the fastmixin doen't show transaction

- let the JavaAgent print the revision of subversion & the release version; this helps to locate problems.

- stress test for strictlinkedblockingdeque

---------------------------------------------------------------
idea:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- tx reuse? So if an aborted or committed transaction is found and a new tx needs to start,
could this old tx be reused? 

- a tranlocal that can't be used for listening to; causes less space, but also reduces
stress on the memory bus because of no reads need to be done on the listeners (no
reads and no writes)/

- profile: number of retries needed for a transaction to complete.

- when a test fails, the report should be stored somewhere so that it won't be lost when
clean is done.

- instead of having a locked bit, the tranlocal could have access to the transaction. Once committed,
this reference can be set to null. Can also be used for detecting if a tranlocal can in from a different
transaction.

- provide as much as possible to point to failures in the byteocode (missing
parts for example) which class/method it was.. for debugging purposes of course

- a performance test comparing the 'managed ref' approach vs the full blown multiverse approach.

- a performance comparison between 'uninstrumented' code and instrumented code.

- a performance comparison between profiled and unprofiled code.

- statistics about number of loads that could get information from the transaction instead
of loading from main memory. This is also needed for optimizing bytecode.

- could the abort and retry mechanism be implemented more efficiently? Atm the whole transaction
is aborted and the complete transaction needs to be re-done. A more efficient implemention could block
and wait until a write has happened on some field and continue with the operation, just like a classic
wait/notify.

- more efficient wait/notify: for example the balancedtree and sleeping for a specific key. Atm
all objects loaded by a transaction are a reason to wake up (cause a change happens on them). But
what if you are only interested in a specific field... this could reduce the stress on the mechanism

- door onderscheid te maken tussen attachednew en loaded, zou je eventueel nog optimalisaties kunnen doen:
     - op nieuw objecten hoef je geen lock aan te vragen
     - op nieuw objecten hoef je niet te valideren
     - op nieuw objecten hoef je geen lock te releasen
     - op nieuw objecten hoef je je niet druk te maken over retrylisteners

- online pessimistic locking

- bloomfilter

- abort silently

- ipv de cheap latch zou je ook de monitor lock van de transactie kunnen gebruiken.
Dit scheelt nog een object creatie.

- timeout tijd.. spaarrekening waar je iedere keer vanaf kunt boeken.

- de timeout tijds op de locks zetten

- managed ref annotation: by setting a ref, you don't force an object to an atomic object
but a normal object using a managed ref.

- shake out concurrency bugs

    - insert random delays in the fastatomicobject

    - insert random delays in alphaupdatetransaction

    - insert random delays in alphareadonlytransaction

    - rerun tests with the bug shakers on

- should the locks be released when the write is done, or should the locks be released
  when the all the writes have been done. Normally this would not be an issue, but there are
  problems when atomic objects refer to other atomic objects that have not been written. In
  these cases you could run into a loadexception

---------------------------------------------------------------
done
---------------------------------------------------------------

- exclude can now also be placed on method to exclude it from being transactional.

- the exponentialbackoffpolicy now uses LockSupport.partNanos instead of the unreliable (for short delays)
Thread.sleep.

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor_constructorTest

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor need correct worker names by using some kind of counter

- relaxed clock in combination with writeskew

- upgrade to clover

- growing/schrinking of the TransactionalThreadPool is not perfect

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor_setMaxPoolSizeTest

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor_stressLongTest

- TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor is not doing anything with the maximum pool size
  (it also needs to rely on some kind of timeout so that unused threads are dropped).

- the long running tests are not part of the normal maven install anymore..

 - clover should be disabled while executing the integration tests.
