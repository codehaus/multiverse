FEATURES

- activating/deactivating sensor points runtime (so zoom in, and zoom out).

- transactions/second on txFactoryLevel

- Developer edition: can be done from the code.

- Enterprise edition: can be done from the outside (while the application is running in
production).

- Transaction length information
    - when a transaction commits, it should store the length. This makes it possible to see
    average size, maximum size etc.

- retrieve transaction length

- an STM should maintain a list of transactionfactories? Problem is with throw away transactionfactories
 since they could cause memory leaks.
