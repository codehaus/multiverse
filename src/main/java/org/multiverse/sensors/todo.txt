IDEAS

- cheap publishing of information

- how to cheaply add the meters

- sampling: so one in n calls gets profiled

- dynamic activation & deactivation of sensors.

- transaction size

- cheap lookup of sensor: can be added to the transaction config.. -> independent transactions
don't cause contention.

- new transaction config needs to be created when transactionfactorybuilder is retrieved.

DONE

- number of failed transactions

- number of completed transactions

- max attempts

- total number of retries

- avg number of retries

- number of started transaction.
