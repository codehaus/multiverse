ideas:

- selective notifies in transaction, instead of always waking up.. one could provide a function that only wakes
 up under certain conditions.


- actor atomic block, doesn't look at an existing transaction. Automatically exposes the onAbort/onCommit

- non repeatable read?

- on read/ on write function
    - stuff like encryption and security could be added through this general purpose mechanism

- reset the speculative stuff once and a while.

- some spinning is allowed for the read conflict scan:
    is this desirable? If it is locked, chances are high that and update already is done or is going
    to be done.

- it possible to work with a stripe of conflict counters?

- is it possible to do something with biased locking? So could an object be biased towards a
transaction? This saves times if the object is read/updated by one thread repeatedly... privatization

- is it possible to replace the snzi on the fly? So start with a cheap one (the uncontended snzi)
and upgrade to a more complex one if needed.

- a mechanism to count the number of cas statements needed.

- write validation: can it be optimized? If the conflict counter has not changed, you know that no other
transaction has caused any conflicting writes. So you know that there is no write conflict.

- make distinction between arriveForRead/arriveForWrite and upgradeArriveForReadToArriveForWrite

- it is important that once a transaction has read a read biased orec, that it doesn't do a depart.
Because the orec could have been changed to write biased. This will be not possible because:
a tranlocal can't be

- generate different classes: for conflict counter directly and for conflict counter with an array.

- when a transaction needs to wait for a lock, can it help another transaction?

- contention management.

- safe way to use multiple stm's (refs need to store the stm they belong to and transaction
 needs to detect if there is a conflict. Problem is with non fresh refs

- expose lock for read.

- expose lock for write.

- read transaction still can be expensive because some read tracking is needed when it hits
non permanent.

- the class index makes it easy to create some kind of arrays that store all kind of information
  on the transactional class level. The question is how to to do it for transactions. You don't want to
  publish it every time.

- and what about 'snapshots'? so only doing it 1 of the n calls.

- bug shaker

- ref: the registerRetrylatch should also do the abort.

- is it possible to combine pessimistic locking with blockingEnabled? What if a transaction wants to wait for a lock
to become free... so can when a lock unlease is done, see if there are listeners before releasing the lock? If
done before, the transaction knows it can remove the current listeners with the a cas, and add them to the set
of listeners that to be notified. If a transaction wants to block ...
when a normal transaction... when a lock is acquired, a retry error should also be thrown.

- support for listener: can be done by providing the previous tranlocal. If that is not the same as the
current tranlocal.. can you retry immediately? Watch out with updates because you need to use the
origin. The problem with the old approach, is that an additional volatile read is needed and this kills
performance.

- use the function's for the atomic change functions

- improved backoff policy

- durability:
    only when committing, a dirty transactional object needs to be checked if it is durable. If it isn't
    no unitofwrite needs to be used. If it is, a unit of write needs to be used. So the commit needs to

- write bit in the orec? Can be used to indicate to another transaction wants to write.. when committing and
 exclusive writebit set by another transaction, no write can happen. The advantage of purely locking is that
 reads still can happen even though it is 'locked' exclusively for writing by one transaction.

- create an orec that never become readbiased (useful for performance comparison).



todo

- can it be that there is an isolation problem on the load in combination with pooling? because a tranlocal
can be pooled, the same tranlocal for different commits could be used, so the load could mistake to read an unlocked
value even though it is locked.

- atomic change methods on ref should call the backoff policy

- atomic change methods on ref should deal with listeners

- mono transaction: support for orelse

- array transaction:  support for orelse

- array tree transaction: support for orelse

- mono transaction and unstarted state

- array transaction and unstarted state

- map transaction and unstarted state

- unshared atomicget, with periodic atomicset.

- mono transaction can do a cheap read of the current tranlocal already is permanent.
    - can only be done if a permanent tranlocal is never pooled.

- transaction completely optimized for ref.

- integratie into the main multiverse branch

- tracing

- when hard reset is done, no new local conflict counter is created, so still attached to the old
globalconflict counter.

- fat mono transaction: failing lifecyclelistener while committing

- fat array transaction: failing lifecyclelistener while committing

- fat arraytree transaction: failing lifecyclelistener while committing

- stm callback for external logic. goal should be that lean transactions still are usable

- blocking and speculative readtracking?

- readonly transactions are getting slow, they were 100M and dropped to 40M. So need to be put back to 100M.

- clojure: add watch. Basic functionality already is there, but atm it is done to all
     reads and not specific ones.

- commute

    - testing of transaction access while commute

    - commute: commuting functions are executed in reverse order.

- rollbackfor/rollnotbackfor exception configuration

- testing: atomic block & propagation and committed/aborted/prepared/new transaction on threadlocal

- lean mono should not upgrade to array when untracked read is done, but should just attach it to the transaction.

- speculative + register doesn't combine because it can lead to transaction not accepting the task and therefor
the task not being executed at all.

- when all reads/writes are pessimistic, cheap conflict detection and cheap prepare.

- openForConstruction on generic transactional object should return current type of tranlocal

- openForRead on generic transactional object should return current type of tranlocal

- openForWrite on generic transactional object should return current type of tranlocal

- pooling for generic transactional object tranlocals.

- array transaction: on commit/abort the array can be nulled. no need to do it when placing in the pool

- array tree transaction: on commit/abort the array can be nulled. no need to do it when placing in the pool
  or when initializing.

- generate the refs/reffactory instead of writing them manually.

- refs & atomic methods

- refs & transaction required methods.

- should the retry by added to the transaction? Makes it easier to figure out when a retry is done when
and not allowed. So not throw the retry error immediately..

- transactional linked list

- transactional array

- listeners are not cleaned after abort/commit, so still a potential memory leak

done

- the nodes for the commute functions need to be pooled.

- testing: mono transaction and conflict counter setting

- testing: array transaction and conflict counter setting

- support for a booleanref (can be based on the int-ref functionality since a boolean internally is represented
as a int).

- support for a doubleref

- ref and await

- abort commute on nullpointer function

- getAndAlter & alterAndGet.

- stm needs to be integrated in the ref as field.. so each ref has access to the stm it is part of.

- test of boxing vs non boxing.. so ref vs longref.

- get without arguments needs to be exposed in ref

- set with value needs to be exposed in ref.

- alter needs to be exposed in ref.

- expose the ref

- place part of the objectpool in the transaction? This prevents it from needing to be retrieved every time.

- BetaObjectPool -> BetaTransactionPool

- BetaTransactionContentPool -> BetaObjectPool

- when commute function is evaluated, there should be protection against openForXXX on transaction.

- openForRead & commute and readconflict

- openForWrite & commute and readconflict

- cleaned up registerChangeListener and abort, logic for what type of registration is now completely
  in the ref itself.

 - when a commuting function fails, the transaction should be aborted.

- mono transaction: simplify openForRead & commute

- array tree transaction: simplified openForRead & commute

- array transaction: simplified openForRead & commute

- problem with PessimisticLock.Write and commitDirty since the dirty flag is not set (and no changes written).

- registerAndAbort: doesn't deal with commuting values correctly. it sees it as a correct read

- deadlock stress test should be modified with different levels of locking.

- testing: commute & overflow of array

- testing: commute & overflow of mono

- testing: commute: check if conflict counters are set correctly when an addCommute is done

- benchmark scripts moved to separate directory

- initial support for externalizing the refs added.

- gradle build script

- expose if lock is free

- expose if lock is owned by current transaction

- expose if lock is owned by other transaction

- atomic inc on refs for values

- benchmarks removed from main src.

- benchmarks scripts update to point to gradle & to test classes

- transaction.prepareForPooling & add it to objectpool.
   - make sure that the object that are pooled, are not a potential source of memory leaks. E.g. transactions
   still holding references to old data.

- reftranlocal is now guaranteed not to contain any state.
