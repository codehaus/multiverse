--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- commute: while commuting, no transaction accessed allowed.

- readonly/readbiased

- read consistency

- speculative size for full conflict scan

- last readwrite conflict should show which transactional object caused it.

- GammaDoubleRef.atomicGetAndIncrement

- GammaIntRef.atomicIncrement

- listeners

- permanent listeners

- check read+locklevel & write+locklevel

- look at the unlock after a write.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        done
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- once a commuting tranlocal is made read/write, should a conflict check be done?

- GammaRef.atomicGetAndSet

- fat atomic block for propagation needs to be migrated from beta to gamma engine

- LockLevel is removed

- atomicToString for refs

- GammaIntRef.toString

- GammaLongRef.toString

- GammaDoubleRef.toString

- GammaBooleanRef.toString

- GammaRef.toString

- beta stm needs to be removed

- fat transaction template.

- open for construction

- transaction: copy for speculative failure

- stm conflict detection

- commute for int ref

- commute for boolean ref

- commute for double ref

- commute for ref

- add commuting state for tranlocal

- write skew

- mono tx comit and different types

- mono transaction and retry

- array transaction and retry

- map transaction and retry

- ref

- doubleref

- intref

- booleanref

- listeners need to be retrieved after commit

- mono gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- array gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- map gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- removed all the openForRead/openForWrite/commute/openForConstruction on the transaction

- speculative stuff is in place.

- transaction messages are fixed

- race problem fixed with the readlocking

- lock upgrade testing on open for write

- lock upgrade testing on open for read

- upgrade from readlock to commit lock

- upgrade readlock to write lock.

- testing: correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and mono tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and mono tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and array tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and array tx

- lean map transaction

- lean map transaction: add prepare

- test for locate

- prepare for mono transaction

- prepare for array transaction

- read lock

- write lock

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and mono tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and mono tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and array tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and array tx

- renamed leanarray to array

- renamed leanmono to mono

- lean mono transaction: add prepare

- lean array transaction: add prepare

- gamma long ref now implements the longref interface

- gamma transaction now implement transaction interface

- gamma transaction config now implement transactionconfig interface

- testing overflow: open for read

- testing overflow: open for write

- readonly

- gamma stm now implements the stm interface

- GammaBooleanRef.atomicAlter

- GammaDoubleRef.atomicAlterSupport

- GammaIntRef.atomicAlter

- GammaRef.atomicAlter

- GammaRef.atomicCompareAndSet

- GammaMapTransaction.prepare and readlock level

- GammaArrayTransaction.prepare and readlock level

- GammaMonoTransaction.prepare and readlock level
