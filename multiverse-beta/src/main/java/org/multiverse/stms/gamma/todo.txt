--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- active logging on block?

- commute: while commuting, no transaction accessed allowed.

- readonly/readbiased

- listeners

- permanent listeners

- look at the unlock after a write.

- downsizing of the map transaction on hard reset.

- selecting the right map transaction size based on previous executions.

- commute and locking

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        done
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- last readwrite conflict should show which transactional object caused it.

- stacktrace is not filled for reused transactions. This helps to prevent developers from looking in the wrong place.

- GammaDoubleRef.atomicGetAndIncrement

- GammaIntRef.atomicIncrement

- check read+locklevel & write+locklevel
