--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- commute: while commuting, no transaction accessed allowed.

- listeners

- permanent listeners

- pre/post start listeners and fat gamma block

- commute and locking

- optimize the tx-pool logic (instead of using an array, use a single linked list)..
transactions can also act as node (no need to introduce additional datastructures).

- fast 'write' on orec.depart when exclusive lock and no surplus

- fast readset validation on committing transaction if the conflict counter has not changed
needs more research.

- stripe of conflict counters.

- testing: atomic change operations and globalconflictcounter increment

- local conflict counter should be set if needed when the flatten commute is called.

                        done

- ensure now also is part of the speculative stuff.
