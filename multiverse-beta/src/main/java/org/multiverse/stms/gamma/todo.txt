--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- mono gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- array gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- map gamma transaction: release listeners after write

- stm conflict detection

- commute: while commuting, no transaction accessed allowed.

- transaction: copy for speculative failure

- readonly/readbiased

- read consistency

- different types

- write skew

- speculative size for full conflict scan

- add constructing state for tranlocal

- add commuting state for tranlocal

- transaction template.

- mono transaction and retry

- array transaction and retry

- map transaction and retry

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        done
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- speculative stuff is in place.

- transaction messages are fixed

- race problem fixed with the readlocking

- lock upgrade testing on open for write

- lock upgrade testing on open for read

- upgrade from readlock to commit lock

- upgrade readlock to write lock.

- testing: correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and mono tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and mono tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and array tx

- testing:  correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and array tx

- lean map transaction

- lean map transaction: add prepare

- test for locate

- prepare for mono transaction

- prepare for array transaction

- read lock

- write lock

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and mono tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and mono tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor read and array tx

- correct mode needs to be determined for openfor write and array tx

- renamed leanarray to array

- renamed leanmono to mono

- lean mono transaction: add prepare

- lean array transaction: add prepare

- gamma long ref now implements the longref interface

- gamma transaction now implement transacton interface

- gamma transaction config now implement transactionconfig interface

- testing overflow: open for read

- testing overflow: open for write

- readonly

- gamma stm now implements the stm interface
