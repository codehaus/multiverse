/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads and transaction to all wait for each other to reach a common
 * barrier point; once this barrier is opened, all transaction atomically commit. A CountDownCommitBarrier is useful
 * in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads/transactions that must occasionally wait for each other.
 * <p/>
 * The CountDownCommitBarrier looks a lot like the {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch}. So if you have
 * experience with that functionality, this one should feel familiar.
 * <p/>
 * A {@code CountDownCommitBarrier} is initialized with a given <em>count</em>. The
 * {@link #joinCommit(org.multiverse.api.Transaction)}  await} methods block until the current count reaches
 * zero due to invocations of the {@link #countDown} method, after which  all waiting threads are released. Unlike the
 * CountDownLatch, it isn't allowed for a new transaction to call one of the join methods after the barrier has
 * aborted or committed.
 * <p/>
 * This functionality is useful for two phase commit related functionality.
 * <p/>
 * The CountDownCommitBarrier can't be reused, so it is not cyclic like the {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier}.
 * <p/>
 * A CountDownCommitBarrier is thread-safe to use of course.
