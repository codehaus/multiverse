 * A blockingAllowed structure that can be used to create blocking transactions. When a transaction blocks, a
 * 'listener' is added to each read transactional object. This listener is the Latch. Each transactional object
 * can have a set of listeners, see the {@link org.multiverse.stms.beta.Listeners} for more information.
 * <p/>
 * The Latch can safely be garbage collected because it works based on an listenerEra. When a transaction
 * wants to block it gets a Latch from the pool and reset it so it can be used. By resetting it, the listenerEra-counter
 * is incremented, so that call to open or await are ignored.
