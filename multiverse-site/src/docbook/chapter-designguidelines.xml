            This chapter contains information contains information about design guidelines for setting
            up a system that uses STM.

        <title>AtomicBlock per atomic method</title>
        <para>
            It is best, if there are more than 1 method that needs to have its own transaction, that each of these
            methods gets it own AtomicBlock. It is useful for debugging purposes because you can see which transaction
            is causing problems. It also is more useful for the speculative mechanism, so that the system is able to
            learn from each AtomicBlock independently; so is able to select the optimal configuration for each
            individual method.

        <title>AtomicBlock at service level</title>
        <para>
            It is best to prevent making every method transaction (so have it own AtomicBlock). In most
            cases it is best to have one high level methods that should be have an AtomicBlock, and the internals
            can lift on the transaction provided. This is comparable to using database transactions; you create
            your transactional services, but underneath no transaction management is needed.
