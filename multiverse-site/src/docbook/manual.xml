        <para>After almost a year of hard and backbreaking work, Multiverse 0.7 was finally released. It is a complete
            rewrite from the previous releases where a lot of effort was made on removing some fundamental problems with
            the 0.6 design (the need for a shared clock was reduced considerably), so it should scale a lot better.
            Also the performance was increased considerably, and last but not least a whole new set of new features are added
            like commuting operations, pessimistic locking, isolation and propagation levels etc.
        </para>

        <para>
            Also the instrumentation was removed and the focus for this release is completely on transactional references.
            The instrumentation will be added in the future.
