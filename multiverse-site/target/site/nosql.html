<h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
The NoSQL database movement promotes migrating away from traditional sql databases as the default solution
to share state and synchronize state changes between transactions. I have seen enough customers with:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>high development costs:</b> caused by complex software. Often the mismatch between objects and
        relational databases is the cause although a good or-mapper can ease the pain. Another cause
        is that developers need to work around database limitations (e.g. the lack of thread notification).
    </li>
    <li><b>performance problems</b> caused by too much synchronization, or just overflowing it with too many
        small queries instead of using a caching solution. I often see databases being misused for managing very
        volatile information like tracking the progress of some task.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>race problems:</b> although databases provide a declarative form of concurrency control using isolation
        levels, it is hard to get right because using the highest isolation level often is not an option
        and you need to deal with race problems or use database specific extensions like the select for update.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>high deployment costs:</b> adding a database to the equation causes a lot of extra work; installing,
        tuning and maintaining the database and of course struggling with database and infrastructure level security.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>high license costs:</b> some databases are free, but the big ones cost money. It is important to
        understand that I'm not saying that commercial databases are no good, but if have seen enough projects
        where that money better could have been spend on good cluster software (like Gigaspaces or Oracle Coherence)
        than on very expensive database solutions (for example Oracle Real Application Cluster).
    </li>
</ol>
I think Multiverse and transactional memory systems in general, could play a role in the NoSQL movement by providing
a solution with unique properties like excelent performance and making it possible to build advanced concurrent
datastructures without the complexity of a lock based approach.

<h2 id="excellent.performance">2 Excellent performance</h2>
I think it is going to be very hard to outperform a STM on a single JVM if you compare it to any commercial or opensource
SQL database out there. If everything is done in memory (so no netwerk or disk io)
performance could be hundreds or even thousands of times higher than if you are using a traditional database.
<p/>
Doing hondred thousands to a few million update transaction per second, and perhaps a another magnitude more
readonly transactions, is realizable with STM. Ofcourse this depends on the transaction being executed (it could be
suffering from contention or do a lot of work for example). And once transactional memory instructions has been added
to the CPU's, you could have hybrid transactional memory systems that can outperform any software based one. That is
why I expect that transactional memory systems are going to play a very important role in the future.
<p/>
Ofcourse to get this performance, some consessions need to be done. On of the most important one is relaxation
of the durability property. If a persistance mechanism eventually is added to Multiverse, there propably
will be a delay between the moment the commit finished and the moment that the changes have been saved on
disk and are able to survive a powerloss. This is called a 'write behind' and a technique a lot of big players
like Gigaspaces/Terracotta in the grid industry apply to get good performance.

<h2 id="perfect.isolation">3 Perfect isolation</h2>
Traditional SQL Databases defined a set of isolation levels that define which isolation problems
are and are not allowed. And you can choose between performance and correctness. The big advantage
of Software Transactional Memory (at least the TL2 based ones) is that is doesn't allow a lot
of lower isolation problems to happen (no dirty reads, always repeatable reads and never phantom reads).
So you get a serialized isolation level out of the box (almost serialized, see... for more information
about the writeskew problem). And you can even make it more strict than is possible on MVCC
databases like Oracle/Postgresql/MySQL + Innodb.

<h3 id="not.only.isolation.also.notification">3.1 Not only isolation also notification</h3>
One of the things that always annoys me with databases, it that it is hard to listen to changes. In most cases some
kind of polling mechanism is added (often Quartz or ScheduledExecutor based) that checks the database for
changes. But a more fine grained mechanism isn't available.
<p/>
With Multiverse you are able to listen to changes and combined with non blocking transactions, you could create
millions of transactions that all are blocking on different sets of data, while only needing a few
threads.

BlockingQueues, ConcurrentMap etc

<h2 id="consistency.through.java.objects">4 Consistency through Java objects</h2>
Consistency is the property that guarantees that all transaction start with a consistent view of the system
and leave the system in a consistent state. In traditional databases in some cases you need to struggle
with triggers, but in Multiverse it all can be done in memory by the Java objects themselves. So no
other mechanism is needed, just write well behaving java objects. And if you really can't say anything
anymore about consistency, just abort the transaction and pray it works better next time (or finally start
throwing TooManyRetriesException if the stm detects that a transaction is livelocking.

<h2 id="atomicity">5 Atomicity</h2>
Failure atomicity is the property that guarantees that all writes are written, or non of them happen. For example
when a transfer of money between two accounts is executed, the changes on both accounts will be written
or no changes at all will be written. Out of the box all Multiverse transactions will guarantee this
behavior.

<h2 id="durability">6 Durability</h2>
If you need the state to be persisted, it is best to
allow for write behind (so the actual state becomes durable after the transaction commit)
instead of a write through solution (that becomes durable in the commit).
<p/>
Once Multiverse exposes access to the tranlocals to be stored, I think some really cool stuff could be done.
One of the simlest things is to write the content periodically to file (in large batches).
With multiverse you also can have access to all the changes made in the transaction (there is
a perfect and stable before view and a perfect after after (although you could get read conflicts if
reads are not tracked because other transactions have updated, and the older versions dont exist anymore.

If the persistance is in place, you really have <a href="persistant.datastructures">Persistent datastructures</a>
in place/

<h3 id="flashback.queries">6.1 Flashback queries</h3>
With Multiversioning, you can have a perfect view on every commit done in the system. If previous state is persisted,
you could execute transaction that go back in time. Oracle provides this feature and calls it flashback queries.
But once the persistance mechanism is added, this would be peanuts.

So not only the actual state is updated, the previous versions also are available.

<h3 id="buildin.audit.trail">6.2 Build-in audit trail</h3>
As soon as the persistance mechanism is added, it can also be used as audit trail. You can see
exactly wich changes have been made after each commit. Normally you would have to need some
audit trail logic manually, but with Multiverse and flashback queries you can see the 'world' as at was
at any moment in time (as long as the history still exists of course).

<h2 id="schema.free">7 Schema Free</h2>
There is no need to create an upfront database schema containing all the tables and columns. Just create the
Java Objects and the STM will take care of the rest (perhaps with a little bit of assistance from the instrumentation
process). So this also takes away the hasle of keeping the schema in sync with your objects.

<h2 id="no.or.mapping">7.1 No or-mapping</h2>
No or-mapping, so don't need to deal with the mismatch between the database and objects. Just a the TransactionalObject
annotation to the object that needs to be transactional, and you are done in most cases. This is a lot less
complex then dealing with traditional databases, even if you are using an or mapper like Hibernate.

<h4>Sidenote</h4>
I personally prefer having an explicit database scheme than letting the or-mapper maintain it for me. Especially
if you are doing a version upgrade, you need a reliable way to migrate the database from one version to the next.

<h2 id="bad.scalability">8 Bad scalability</h2>
This is going to be a hard nut to crack I think. Multiverse (and all other TL2 based STM's) have a single
shared clock (could be an AtomicLong) to determine if read or write problems occurred. If the transactional
objects are distributed, the clock needs to be distributed as well and this is going to be a scalability
bottleneck. If the increase of the clock takes 1 ms over the cluster, the maximum number of transactions/second
would be 1000. No matter how much hardware you are adding to the equation (eventually the performance could
start to decrease).
<p/>
Ofcourse you could always add some form of partitioning the the system, that multiple STM instances could
run in parallel.

<h2 id="low.availability">9 Low Availability</h2>
This is also a weakspot since the nature of STM is to deal with volatile data but also since most
current stm implementations are hard to scale caused by the global clock. But as soon as durability is added to
Multiverse, replicating state between machines would not be that hard. So keeping a backup in sync should not be
that hard to realize (especially if you allow for a delay between synchronization and having a window of
inconsistency).

<h2 id="easy.deployment">10 Easy deployment</h2>
With traditional databases you need to deal with all kinds of issues. First of all you need to get the database
up and running on your machine, an it also needs to be set up in the rest of the environments (acceptance
and production for example). Next to that yo need to deal with getting the schema up and running on
each system and make sure that the rights and firewalls are configured correctly. This is one of the things
that always annoys me when dealing with databases.
<p/>
With Multiverse the 'database' is running in the same JVM as the application and automatically is started and
stopped when the JVM starts and stops. And combine this with that Multiverse doesn't need a schema, and the
deployment feels like non existent.

<h2 id="not.limited">11 Not limited to the internal structures</h2>
You are not limited to b-trees and other ... but you can create your own and use these in transactions.
hashmap, trees, skiplists etc etc.

<h2>Embedded in the JVM</h2>
So not working with yet another language (SQL) that isn't to perfect match for object oriented languages.
Everything can be done in Java code (or a Java based language like Scala or Groovy for example).
