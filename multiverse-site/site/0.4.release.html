<h2>Multiverse 0.4</h2>

Multiverse 0.4 was released at 24 Februari 2010. The following features have been added:
<ol>
    <li>
        Read-tracking readonly transaction: unlike a non tracking readonly transaction,
        a tracking readonly transaction is able to participate in blocking operations because it knows
        which transactional objects have been read and therefor which objects to listen to. A tracking
        readonly transaction also is less subject to read-conflicts. This disadvantage of this transaction
        is that it requires more resources than a non tracking readonly transaction. One of the ways
        this functionality is exposed, is through the trackReads property of the TransactionalMethod
        annotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Non read-tracking update transaction: unlike a tracking update transaction, a non tracking
        update transaction doesn't consume more resources for reads. The disadvantage is that it can't
        participate in blocking operations because it isn't known which reads have been executed. One of the ways
        this functionality is exposed, is through the trackReads property of the TransactionalMethod
        annotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interruptible transactional methods: makes it possible to wakeup a Transaction when it
        does a blocking operation like waiting an a blocking queue for an item to appear. One of the ways to
        activate this behavior is through the interruptible property of the @TransactionalMethod annotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional writeskew detection: in readtracking update transactions. If writeskew detection is enabled,
        concurrent executing transaction will appear to be executing serially. If writeskew detection is not
        enabled, the system could be subject to certain isolation problems. For more information see the
        following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation">link</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        TransactionalThreadPoolExecutor: a Transactional clone of the java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor
        where the execute methods can participate in transactions. This makes it possible that tasks are executed
        atomically (so all of them are executed or none of them).
    </li>
    <li>
        Transactional primitives like the TransactionalInteger and TransactionalBoolean. Useful for having
        transactional primitive fields that reduce creation of short lived wrappers (like the Integer or Long)
        that cause gc stress. The following primitives have been added:
        <ul>
            <li>TransactionalBoolean</li>
            <li>TransactionalByte</li>
            <li>TransactionalCharacter</li>
            <li>TransactionalDouble</li>
            <li>TransactionalFloat</li>
            <li>TransactionalInteger</li>
            <li>TransactionalLong</li>
            <li>TransactionalShort</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Self learning transactional implementation selector: based on runtime observation the system is
        able to select the transaction implementation that is optimal for a certain number of reads and or writes.
        The system begins with an implementation transaction (all transactions belonging to a transaction
        family to be precise) that is small and once these implementation complain that they are not big enough
        a 'bigger' implementation is selected. The following transaction 'tastes' are created.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tiny:</b> optimized for a single tracked read or update</li>
            <li><b>Fixed: </b> optimized for transactions with a very small number of tracked reads or
                updates.
            </li>
            <li><b>Growing:</b> optimized for a larger number of tracked reads or updates</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        2 phase commit: this makes it possible to create barrier like synchronization structures
        where all transactions commit or none commit. The performance of the 2phase commit can't be compared
        to a distributed 2 phase commit (which is orders of magnitude slower).
    </li>
    <li>
        Easier to embed: that want to embed Multiverse without relying
        on the instrumentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction access: instead of going to the ThreadLocalTransaction to retrieve the Transaction
        every time it is used in the instrumented code, every transactional method is 'widened' so that the
        transaction reference is passed as additional argument.
    </li>
</ol>
