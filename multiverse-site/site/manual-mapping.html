<h2 id="introduction">1.1 Introduction</h2>
One of the main goals of Multiverse, is to create a STM implementation that seamlessly integrates in Java. This is done
based on placing special annotations on POJO's combined with bytecode instrumentation, to add the logic. This
chapter contains all the information about how to map POJO's to transactions.

<h2 id="transactionalobject">1.2 TransactionalObject</h2>
The easies way in Multiverse to make an object transactional, is to add the @TransactionalObject annotation, e.g.:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{
        private int balance;

        public Account(int initialBalance){
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        }

        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public setBalance(int newBalance){
            this.balance = newBalance;
        }
    }
</pre>
By adding the annotation, this object has become transactional:
<ol>
    <li><b>failure atomicity:</b> all changes are written or non of them are written</li>
    <li><b>isolated:</b> transaction will not observe changes made by concurrent executing transactions. So
        no worries about race problems.
    </li>
    <li><b>deadlock free:</b> no worries about the order in which resources are used because the transactions will not
        deadlock.
    </li>
    <li><b>composable:</b> transactional methods can be composed to create new transactional methods.
    </li>
</ol>
So all reads/writes on instance fields (static field and final fields are completely ignored) will
be done through a transaction.

<h3 id="transactionalobject.finalfields">1.2.1 @TransactionalObject and final fields</h3>
When the @TransactionalObject annotation is placed on a POJO, automatically all non final fields will be managed
by Multiverse (there is no need to). All final fields are competely ignored by the STM.
<p/>
So Multiverse promotes the use of final fields where possible because this not only gives better performance,
immutable structures are reduce complexity in a lot of cases because you don't need to worry about if the object
still is in a consistent state.

<h3 id="transactionalobject.and.volatile.fields">1.2.2 @TransactionalObject and volatile fields</h3>
If a @TransactionalObject contains a volatile field, the system completely ignores this field. This is exactly the
same as adding an <a href="#exclude">@Exclude</a> annotation. So volatile fields can be used if transactional
memory also is combined with more traditional concurrency approaches.

<h3 id="transactionalobject.without.managed.fields">1.2.3 @TransactionalObject without managed fields</h3>
If transactional object doesn't contain any fields to manage (so volatile, final, static) the transactional
object will be completely invisible to the stm. So there will not be any stress on the transaction.
Of course the instance methods of these objects still are transactional.

<h3 id="transactionalobject.limitations">1.2.4 @TransactionalObject and limitations</h3>
Currently there are some limitations:
<ol>
    <li><b>No support for subclassing:</b> it is currently not possible (limitation in the instrumentation)
        to subclass from another transactional object (with managed fields). When the Javaagent encounters this
        situation, it will complain and output some log statements. You can extend from any non transactional object,
        but the transactional properties will not be provided to the super class. So be careful with that.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>No support for arrays:</b> it is currently no possible to get transactional arrays. At the moment the
        reference to the array only is transactional, but the content not.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Not able to manage static fields:</b> although it isn't a problem to use transactional static
        methods, it is not possible to have managed static fields. If a TransactionalObject annotation is placed
        on a POJO with static fields, the static fields will be totally ignored by the stm.
    </li>
</ol>
Some of these limitations will be removed in future releases of Multivere (hopefully in the 0.5 release).

<h2 id="transactionalmethod">1.3 @TransactionalMethod</h2>
The easies way to create transactional methods it place a TransactionalObject annotation on an object. The
instrumentation knows that all <b>instance</b> methods automically receive an update transaction. But in a lot of
cases you want to finetune this behavior or you want to add transactions on methods that are not an
instance method of a transactional object (for example in a different class or static methods). In these
cases the TransactionalMethod annotation can be used.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.readonly">1.3.1 @TransactionalMethod.readonly</h3>
All instance method of a transactional object automatically become update methods. But in some cases it is better
to use a readonly transaction because they often consume less resources than an update or you want to indicate
that no changes can be made through that transaction. If a change is tried in a readonly transaction, a
ReadonlyException will be thrown. A transactional method can be made readonly by setting the readonly property
of the TransactionalMethod annotation, e.g.:

<pre>
     import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        ...

        @Transactional(readonly = true)
        public int setBalance(){
            return balance;
        }
    }
</pre>

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.maxretrycount">1.3.2 @TransactionalMethod.maxRetryCount</h3>
Transactions run in Multiverse can fail for all kinds of reasons:
<ol>
    <li><b>read conflicts:</b> when a transaction tries to load a transactional object for reading or writing,
        but the version it needs, doesn't exist anymore. If the transaction would have been able to see this change,
        you could run into race problems.
    </li>
    <li><b>write conflicts:</b> when a transaction tries to make a write (atm writes in multiverse are deferred to
        the commit and sees that a different transaction made a conflicting write, the transaction is aborted and
        in most cases will succeed the next time.
        If the transaction would have
        have been able to make this write, you could
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>blocking transactions:</b> when a transaction 'blocks', on a lower level the transaction is aborted and
        restarted when a commit is done on one or more of the objects it was listening to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>speculative transaction implementation selection:</b> the stm could decide to start transactions with
    </li>
</ol>
The transaction management logic added to transactional method automatically retries in these situations, because
the next time the transaction executed, it could succeed. But in some cases a transaction is not able to
complete; perhaps the transaction is continuously runs into read or write conflicts caused by contention.
To prevent uncontrolled retrying (this could lead to livelocking), the number of retries default is bound to
1000. With the maxRetryCount this property can be influenced:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        ...

        @TransactionalMethod(readonly = true, maxRetryCount = 10)
        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }
    }
</pre>
The maxRetryCount can be used in combination with all the other TransactionalMethod properties.
<p/>
But be careful:
<ol>
    <li>if you give it a too high value, the system could start to suffer from livelocking</li>
    <li>if you give it a too low value, some transactions will never commit</li>
</ol>
On a lower level the maxRetryCount is combined with a customizable restartBackoffPolicy (with an exponential
backoff policy as the default implementation) to eliviate pressure on contention. In the future this backoff
policy will be exposed through annotations.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.familyname">@TransactionalMethod.familyName</h3>
The familyName of a transaction described a lot about the behavior of that transaction. Luckily when no
transaction familyName is set, the instrumentation will automatically derive one based on the
classpath, methodname and signature. So in 99% of the cases you can ignore the property completely.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.automaticreadtracking">@TransactionalMethod.automaticReadTracking</h3>
When a transaction reads from transactional objects, it can decide to track that read. Readtracking is useful
for multiple purposes:
<ol>
    <li><b>reduce number of read conflicts:</b> if a read is tracked in a transaction, the next time the same
        read is done, the 'cached' value can be returned. If the read is not tracked, it could happen that a
        different transaction does an update between reads and a LoadTooOldVersionException is thrown.
    </li>
    <li><b>blocking transactions:</b> based on the reads done, a transaction is able to figure out on which
        objects to listen when a transaction is blocked. For more information see
        <a href="manual-blocking.html">chapter 2 Blocking transactions</a>.
    </li>
    <li><b>writeSkewPrevention:</b> an isolation problem. For more information see
        <a href="#transactionalmethod.writeskewprevention">@TransactionalMethod.writeSkewPrevention</a>
    </li>
</ol>
Ofcourse readtracking has its price; for each read that is tracked, some kind of registration needs to be done
and this increases the memory and cpu usage of a transaction.
<p/>
By default all readonly transactional methods will not do automaticReadTracking and all update transactions will,
unless explicitly specified otherwise ofcourse.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.writeskewprevention">@TransansactionalMethod.writeSkewPrevention</h3>

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.and.exceptions">@TransactionalMethod and exceptions</h3>
When a TransactionalMethod encounters an exception (no matter if it is checked, unchecked or an error),
it will automatically abort the transaction. In the future this behavior is going to be customizable.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.and.nesting">@TransactionalMethod and nesting</h3>
TransactionalMethods can be nested so they are able to be composed, for example:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        public Account(int initialBalance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }


        @TransactionalMethod(readonly = true)
        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        @TransactionalMethod
        public void setBalance(int newBalance){
            this.balance = newBalance;
        }

        @TransactionalMethod
        public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount){
            from.setBalance(from.getBalance()-amount);
            to.setBalance(to.getBalance()+amount);
        }
    }
</pre>
In this example the transfer method is a composition of 4 other transactional methods (2x getBalance and
2x setBalance). So nesting of transactions is no problem. If you want to know more about nesting behavior,
check <a href="">Chapter XXX: Transaction Nesting</a>.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.and.interfaces">@TransactionalMethod and interfaces</h3>
It is important to realize that @TransactionalMethod don't inherit, so the following example
is not going to give the result you want it to have.

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;

    public interface TransferService{

        @TransactionalMethod
        void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount);
    }

    public class TransferServerImpl implements TransferService{

        public void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount){
            from.setBalance(from.getBalance()-amount);
            to.setBalance(to.getBalance()+amount);
        }
    }
</pre>
Although the methods on the transactional object Account are transactional, the transfer method itself isn't.
So this transfer is subject to race problems; imagine what happens when a different transaction modifies
the balance of the from account just after the from.get() has been called and just before from.set is called.
And it also is subject to lack of atomicity.
<p/>
The lack of inheritance of method annotation in Java is something that has annoyed me from day one, but we have
to live with it.

<h3 id="transactionalmethod.and.the.transactiontemplate">@TransactionalMethod and the TransactionTemplate</h3>
TransactionalMethod can perfectly be combined with TransactionTemplates. For more information about
the TransactionTemplate see <a href="manual-templates.html">chapter 3 Templates</a>.

<h2 id="transactionalconstructor">1.4 @TransactionalConstructor</h2>
The TransactionalConstructor annotation looks a lot like the functionality the TransactionalMethod annotation
provides because it also can make constructors (also a method) transactional. The big difference is that
a constructor can't be retried, so you won't find any retry related properties.
<p/>
A TransactionalConstructor can be added to a constructor of a TransactionalObject to finetune behavior:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        @TransactionalConstructor(automaticReadTracking = false)
        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }
    }
</pre>
In this case the default value true for automaticReadTracking is changed to false.
<p/>
It can also be placed on a constructor of a non transactional object to make use of other transactional objects
within a single transaction, e.g.:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalConstructor;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;

    public final class Sum{

        private int sum;

        @TransactionalConstructor(readonly = true)
        public Sum(TransactionalInteger ref1, TransactionalInteger ref2){
            this.sum = ref1.get()+ref2.get();
        }
    }
</pre>

All properties of the TransactionalConstructor, can also be found in the TransactionalMethod and have exactly
the same meaning:
<ol>
    <li><a href="#transactionalmethod.readonly">readonly</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transactionalmethod.familyname">familyName</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transactionalmethod.automaticreadtracking">automaticReadTracking</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transactionalmethod.preventWriteSkew">preventWriteSkew</a></li>
</ol>
So for more information about these properties, just check the documentation on the TransactionalMethod.

<h3 id="transactionalconstructor.and.blocking">1.4.1 @TransactionalConstructor and blocking</h3>
Because the TransactionalConstructor doesn't support retries, blocking behavior also isn't possible because
this also relies on the ability of transactions to be retried. If you need blocking behavior in the constructor,
you can use the following approach:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class IntValue{
        private int value;

        private IntValue(TransactionalInteger integer){
            integer.await(10);
            value = integer.get();
        }

        @TransactionalMethod
        public static IntValue create(TransactionalInteger integer){
            return new IntValue(integer);     
        }
    }
</pre>
The example is quite useless, but it shows how to add the blocking behavior. It is important to realize that
because the 'create' function can be executed more than once (because of the await in the constructor), that
multiple IntValue's are created.

<h2 id="exclude">1.5 @Exclude</h2>
When a TransactionalObject annotation is placed on an object, all non final instance fields of that object will
automatically be managed by the STM. But in some you want to exclude certain fields. This can be done with the
@Exclude annotation:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.Exclude;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Foo{
        private int a;

        @Exclude
        private int b;

        ...
    }
</pre>
In this example field 'a' is managed and field 'b' is not managed.
<p/>
It is important to realize that the field is not protected by transactions, so it could be subject to all the problems
transactions are trying to prevent. So it should be used wisely.
<p/>
If a @Exclude annotation is placed on a field of a non transactional object, or if the field automatically is excluded
(final, static, volatile) it has no effect and is completely ignored.

<h2 id="fieldgranularity">1.6 @FieldGranularity</h2>
If a transactional object has more than 1 fields, it could be that you get a writeconflict on 2 transactions
writing to different fields, e.g:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Foo{

        private int a;
        private int b;

        ...

        public void incA(){
            a++;
        }

        public void incB(){
            b++;
        }
    }
</pre>
This is caused by that the Multiverse javaagent adds object granularity by default;
meaning that you only get reads/writes on the object level (so all fields are read/written). In some cases you
get unwanted contention on these fields (for example with a linked blocking queue with an independant head
and tail). By placing the @FieldGranularity annotation above a field, you can configure field granularity,
e.g:
<p/>
If one transaction modifies a and another modifies b, one of the transactions is going to fail when it does a commit,
even though from a logical point of view there is no reason to conflict. This is because the conflict occurrs
on the instance level (object granularity) and not on the field level (field granularity). By placing the
@FieldGranualarity annotation above a field, this unwanted cause of contention can be removed:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.FieldGranularity;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Foo{

        @FieldGranularity
        private int a;

        @FieldGranularity
        private int b;

        ...

        public void incA(){
            a++;
        }

        public void incB(){
            b++;
        }
    }
</pre>
Placing the @FieldGranularity on fields of non transactional objects, has no effect (they are completely ignored).
Placing the @FieldGranularity annotation on 'excluded' fields like volatile, final, static of fields with the
@Exclude annotation, has no effect either.
<p/>
What happens under the hood is that the fields are transformed to a TransactionalReference or transactional primitive,
check <a href="manual-referencesandprimitives.html">4 Transactional references and primitives</a> So after the
instrumentation, the code looks like this:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Foo{

        private final TransactionalInteger a = new TransactionalInteger();        
        private final TransactionalInteger b = new TransactionalInteger();

        ...

        public void incA(){
            a.set(a.get()+1);
        }

        public void incB(){
            b.set(b.get()+1);
        }
    }
</pre>
Because the content of a and b have been moved to different transactional objects (the systems sees a transactional
primitive or transactional reference as just another transactional object), there won't be a conflict when
one transaction updates a and another b. Unless writeskew prevention is anabled and both transaction also read
a and b. For more information see <a href="manual-isolation.html">8 Transaction Isolation</a>. Because each
instance method of a transactional object automatically is a transactional method, incA is executed under
a single transaction, so the operation is atomic no matter if @FieldGranularity is used. The same goes
for incB ofcourse.
<p/>
You might wonder why not declare all fields with the @FieldGranularity annotation by default. Although field level
granularity reduce the chance of writeconflicts, it increases the stress on the transaction; so operations like
commit take more time (increasing the chance on read/write conflicts) It also causes increased memory usage
because extra transactional objects and tranlocal objects need to be created.
