<h2 id="introduction">7.1 Introduction</h2>
If you don't want to rely on the instrumentation process for adding custom control logic to the Java language,
you are stuck with templates for the time being (perhaps in Java 7 this is going to be improved with the
introduction of closures). Multiverse provides 2 important templates:
<ol>
    <li><a href="#transactiontemplate">TransactionTemplate</a></li>
    <li><a href="#orelsetemplate">OrElseTemplate</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="transactiontemplate">7.2 TransactionTemplate</h2>
With the TransactionTemplate you can add transactional logic where it is needed without relying
on instrumentation. It automatically manages the transaction(s) and deals with retries. In most cases the
TransactionTemplate it prefered above writing the logic manually could lead to all kinds of problems (the
internals of the transaction management still are subject to chance since Multiverse still is evolving).
The Stm sees no difference between transactions managed by TransactionTemplates or those managed by instrumented
code. So they share all the same facilities.
<p/>

Underneath you can find an example of a transfer of money between two accounts using the TransactionTemplate.
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.templates.TransactionTemplate;

    public static void transfer(final Account from, final Account to, final int amount){
        new TransactionTemplate(){
            public Object execute(Transaction tx){
                if(amount&lt;0){
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException();
                }

                if(from.getBalance()&lt;amount){
                    throw new NotEnoughMoneyException();
                }
                from.setBalance(from.getBalance()-amount);
                to.setBalance(to.getBalance()+amount);    
                return null;
            }
        }.execute();
    }
</pre>
The TransactionTemplate is threadsafe and can be reused if it is considered to be to expensive.
<p/>
If you need to return a value, you can parametrize the transaction template.
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.templates.TransactionTemplate;

    public int void sum(final Account a, final Account b){
        return new TransactionTemplate&lt;Integer&gt;(){
            public void execute(Transaction ex){
                return a.getBalance()+b.getBalance();
            }
        }.execute();
    }
</pre>
The cool thing about transactions is that you will always get a consistent answer because a transaction uses
a near serialized isolation level.

<h3 id="transactiontemplate.and.nesting">7.2.1 TransactionTemplate and nesting</h3>
The TransactionTemplate follows the only nesting approach Multiverse currently has: flattening. So everything
is done in the context of the outer transaction. The TransactionTemplate can perfectly be combined with
instrumented classes. If the Transaction is aborted or committed explicitly, the whole transaction will
commit or abort and following operations on the transaction will fail with a DeadTransactionException.

<h3 id="transactiontemplate.and.the.transactionfactory">7.2.2 TransactionTemplate and the TransactionFactory </h3>
Although the TransactionFactory provides some convenience constructors, it is best to pass a
TransactionFactory to the TransactionTemplate when you construct one. This TransactionFactory is created
by a TransactionFactoryBuilder and this is the location where you set all kinds of transaction properties.
For more information see chapter 6 <a href="manual-api.html">Multiverse API</a>.
<h4>Setting the transaction family name</h4>
If you want to give Multiverse the chance to learn about your transactions and do runtime optimizations
like selecting better suiting transaction implementations, it is important that you set the familyName
on the TransactionFactoryBuilder. The familyName is the way for Multiverse to recognize different
transactions and do the optimizations. If you use instrumentation, the familyName is infered by the instrumentation
process, so no worries about that.

<h3 id="transactiontemplate.and.transaction.lifecycle.events">7.2.3 TransactionTemplate and transaction lifecycle
    events</h3>
In some cases you need execute actions (for example starting threads or cleaning up resources) after or before
an abort or commit executes. Tasks can be executed using the
<a href="manual-lifecycleevents.html">chapter 3: Transaction lifecycle events</a>
<p/>
Listening to transaction lifecycle events is not completely free because additional objects need to be created
and registered. If you want to squeeze out the most performance, you can create a TransactionTemplate
with disabled lifecycle listeners. Check the Javadoc for the complete overview of the constructors of the
TransactionTemplate.

<h3 id="transactiontemplate.and.threadlocal">7.2.4 TransactionTemplate and ThreadLocalTransaction</h3>
By default the TransactionTemplate looks at the ThreadLocalTransaction to see if there is a running
transaction, and if needed it creates a new Transaction and it publishes the created transaction on
the ThreadLocalTransaction. If you don't need the ThreadLocalTransaction, you can disable reading/writing
to the TransactionThreadLocal. Reducing access to the threadlocal could improve performance if it is done
very very often. See the complete overview of constructors of the TransactionTemplate for more detailed
information.

<h3 id="transactiontemplate.and.exceptions">7.2.5 TransactionTemplate and exceptions</h3>
If the TransactionTemplate.execute(Transaction) method throws a Throwable, the transaction is
aborted. In future releases there will be more control on this behavior; e.g. by configuring for
which type of exceptions the TransactionTemplate is allowed to commit.
