<h2>Downloading the sources</h2>
If you are not a committer you can execute the following command:
<pre>
git clone git://git.codehaus.org/multiverse.git multiverse
</pre>
This command can be executed in the directory you want to Multiverse project to be checked out. The Multiverse directory
        automatically is created for you.
<p/>
If you are a committer you can execute the following command:
<pre>
git clone ssh://git@git.codehaus.org/multiverse.git
</pre>
If you execute this command, and you haven't registered a 'Authorized Keys' at Codehaus, you will be asked for a password.
I don't know what the password is and it is best to create an key and upload it to codehaus. For more information
about creating a key, check the following <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/HAUS/SSH+Guide">SSH Guide on
    Codehaus</a> and the public part of the key can be copy/paste to your
<a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/my/details">Codehaus details page</a>
A better manual will be provided in the future because this 'getting up and running' stuff always irritates me and
wastes my precious time.
