<h1>Development</h1>
On this page you can find all information related to developing Multiverse. For more information about how to set up
your project that depends on Multiverse, check the <a href="developconfiguration.html">following</a> page.

<h2>Links</h2>
Underneath you can find the most important links:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=multiverse.git">Web-based GIT viewer</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MULTIVERSE">Jira</a> to track the issue. The issues
        still need to be migrated from the old website to JIRA.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MULTIVERSE">Confluence:</a> the (still empty) wiki</li>
    <li><a href="http://bamboo.ci.codehaus.org/browse/MULTIVERSE-DEF">Bamboo:</a> our continuous
        integration server.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/maven-site/index.html">Maven Site:</a> the default (and) ugly
        generated maven site containing all the reports.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Downloading the sources</h2>
If you are not a committer you can execute the following command:
<pre>
git clone git://git.codehaus.org/multiverse.git multiverse
</pre>
This command can be executed in the directory you want the Multiverse project to be checked out. The multiverse directory
automatically is created for you.
<p>
    If you are a committer you can execute the following command:
<pre>
git clone ssh://git@git.codehaus.org/multiverse.git
</pre>
If you execute this command, and you haven't registered a 'Authorized Keys' at Codehaus, you will be asked for a
password. I don't know what the password is and it is best to create an key and upload it to codehaus.
For more information about creating a key, check the following
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/HAUS/SSH+Guide">SSH Guide on Codehaus</a> and the public part of the key
can be copy/paste to your
<a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/my/details">Codehaus details page</a>
A better manual will be provided in the future because this 'getting up and running' stuff always irritates me and
wastes my precious time.

<h2>Building the project</h2>
If you have installed Maven 2, the only thing you need to do is the execute 'mvn clean install' in the root
Multiverse directory. Make sure that you have Java 1.6 or higher installed.

<h2>Running the stress tests</h2>
There are a bunch of stress tests (they are named *StressTest) that run for quite some time (15/20 minutes
on my laptop). They are not executed under a standard phase cause of Clover (the additional instrumentation caused
by clover takes a lot of extra time). At the moment the stress tests are completely disabled, so you need to run
them from your ide.

<h2>Setting up Clover</h2>
Multiverse uses Clover as test coverage tool and out of the box a evaluation license is provided. This license
eventually will expire, so you will need a real license. Luckily Atlassian was kind enough to provide a free
license for the Multiverse project. Please send me (alarmnummer at gmail dot com) and email if you are a committer,
and I'll send you the key.
<p/>
Once you reived the key, you need to change your maven settings. Check the following <a
        href="settings.xml">settings.xml</a>
for more detailed information. Linux users can find this file in the '~/.m2' directory.
