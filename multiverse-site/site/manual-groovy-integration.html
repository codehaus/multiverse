<h2>Groovy support</h2>

Multiverse can be used to build stm support into jvm based languages. Akka framework for scala is also one example.
This is a an attempt to build stm support into groovy. Watch out groovy++ support as well.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        To start using Multiverse in groovy, you will need to start using multiverse-groovy-0.6. Multiverse groovy
        integration depends on alpha stm (the primary stm implemented using the multiverse core).
        TODO: provide maven group id and version number
        TODO: complete dependency list for those not using maven or other dependency management tools

        <h3>Transactional Constructs</h3>

        Below are some of the operational sematics currently supported by multiverse groovy,
        <ol>
            <li>
                Atomic

                The usual approach to gaurd a critical section would be to use locks. If you are using STM I guess
                we can assume that you are already aware of the issues. With multiverse groovy, the critcal section
                needs to be wrapped within the atomic block.

                import static org.multiverse.integration.MultiverseGroovyLibary.*

                <pre>
                atomic {
                   obj.x = 1;
                   if (obj.x != 1) fireMissiles();
                }
                    </pre>

                In the above setup, all configurations for the atomic block are in default settings. The atomic block
                is highly configurable. Below is a version which sheds more light on some configurations that can be
                made.

                <pre>
                atomic(trackreads: true, explicitRetryAllowed: true, timeoutInNanoSeconds: 10) {
                   //mission critical code
                }
                    </pre>

                All the configurations available as part of multiverse alpha stm which is in java.
                are also supported by groovy version

                Please refer to the explanation for these configurations as well.
                TODO: provide link to configuration explanation
            </li>
            <li>
                Retry

                A transaction that executes a retry statement aborts and then reexecutes. This may be
                useful when implenting datastructures like blocking queues.

                <pre>
                public class BlockingQueue {

                  def private TransactionalList buffer
                  def maxSize = 2, timeout

                  BlockingQueue() {
                    buffer = new TransactionalArrayList(maxSize);
                  }

                  Object dequeue() {
                    def ret
                    atomic(explicitRetryAllowed: true, trackreads: true) {
                      if (buffer.isEmpty()) <b>retry()</b>;
                      ret = buffer.pop();
                    }
                    return ret;
                  }

                  void enqueue(value) {
                    atomic(explicitRetryAllowed: true, trackreads: true) {
                      if (buffer.size() >= maxSize) <b>retry()</b>;
                      buffer.add(0, value)
                    }
                  }
                }
                    </pre>

            </li>
            <li>
                OrElseStatement

                This is specially useful when we have two transactions, we start by executung one, when that
                aborts we execute the other transaction. If there is an irrecoverable error in transaction 1
                that will mean transaction 2 will not be executed and exception is bubbled up to the caller.

                <pre>
                new OrElseStatement().identity {
                  either {
                    // critical section 1
                  }
                  orelse {
                    // critical section 2
                  }
                  execute()
                }
                    </pre>

                We are using the identity in groovy to make it easily readable. Underneath the covers both
                "either" and "or" are closures which are executed atomically.

                Like atomic, ever orElseStaement has configurability.

                <pre>
                new OrElseStatement().identity {
                  either {
                    // critical section 1
                  }
                  orelse {
                    // critical section 2
                  }
                  config readonly: true, trackreads: true
                  execute()
                }
                    </pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

    </li>

    <p>We encourage you to checkout our codebase and would be thankful to receive any feedback. There are test
        cases and examples which will help get started. The multiverse manual provide a good overview of the
        alpha stm. Since groovy integration just builds on top of existing infrastructure, please spend some
        understanding multiverse.</p>
