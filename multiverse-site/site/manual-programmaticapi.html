<h2 id="introduction">13.1 Introduction</h2>
One of the main <a href="missionstatement.html">mission statements</a> is the seamless integration in the
Java language. This is based done on annotations in combination with instrumentation
(<a href="manual-javaagent.html">runtime</a> or <a href="manual-compiler.html">compiletime</a>). But Multiverse
isn't limited for being used in the Java language only. One of the other mission statements is that the
heart of Multiverse, should be used just as easily in other JVM based languages like Groovy/Scala/JRuby etc.

<h2 id="transaction">13.2 Configuring the Transaction</h2>
The Transaction can be configured by retrieving the
<a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/apidocs/org/multiverse/api/TransactionFactoryBuilder.html">TransactionFactoryBuilder</a>
from the STM. For more information see the <a href="manual-api.html">Chapter 6: API</a>

<h2 id="transactionTemplate">13.3 TransactionTemplate</h2>
Transaction management is done through the <a href="manual-templates.html">TransactionTemplate</a>. It contains
all the logic you don't want to implement yourself. The transaction template is threadsafe and can be reused so
you could create it in the beginning and store it for later use. If you really need to get the most out of performance
and can't make use of the transactiontemplate, you need to inline the logic in the transactiontemplate
yourself. The big disadvantage is that changes made in the TransactionTemplate (and chances are high that
there will be) will not be done in your code. So you need to make sure that you track changes on the
TransactionTemplate.

<h2 id="api">13.4 Programmatic API</h2>
The Multiverse internals only case object objects implementing certain interfaces, so it doesn't matter if code
is instrumented or written manually; they all look the same to the Stm. For the important interfaces in
you need to look at the org.multiverse.api package. It contains the transaction, stm, clock etc interfaces
you would expect to be there which can be configured manually. The instrumentation uses exactly the same
interfaces, so the programmatic api is not a second class citizen.

<h2 id="programmaticReference">13.5 ProgrammaticReference</h2>
The <a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/apidocs/org/multiverse/api/programmatic/ProgrammaticReference.html">ProgrammaticReference</a>
provides a transactional reference without being dependant on instrumentation. The ProgrammaticReference can
be compared with the refs in:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://doc.akkasource.org/stm">Akka</a> (uses Multiverse in combination with the
        Programmatic API)
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://ppl.stanford.edu/ccstm/site/intro.html">CCStm</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://clojure.org/refs">Clojure</a></li>
</ol>
All changes on references don't suffer from failure atomicity or isolation problems if they are done inside
the context fo a running transaction. The Multiverse STM itself only knows about transactional objects
(so an object with a managed field). The managed references itself is a transactional object with a
single managed field: the value.
<p>
    Managed references are not the holy grail for STM based programming. If you use a managed reference
    for every field that needs to be managed in an object, the overhead is higher than with an object
    granularity. Although the object granularity has a chance of unfair conflicts (2 transaction updating
    different fields on the same transactional object) will fail with object granularity and succeed
    with field granularity. With the @FieldGranularity annotation the instrumentation knows that field
    granularity should be used and rewrites the normal field to a Ref:

<pre>
    //before
    @TransactionalObject
    class LinkedBlockingQueue{

        @FieldGranularity
        Node head;

        @FieldGranularity
        Node tail;

        ...
    }

    //after
    @TransactionalObject
    class LinkedBlockingQueue{

        final Ref&lt;Node&gt; head = new Ref();

        final &lt;Node&gt; tail = new Ref();

        ...
    }
</pre>
All reads and writes are transformed to get/set operations on the Ref.

<p>
    One of the disadvantages is that the total overhead on field granularity is higher if a transactional
    object has more than 1 managed field. In the AlphaStm there even is a special transaction that is amazing
    fast when only one transactional objects is used inside a transaction. So if there is a transactional
    object with 3 managed fields using object granularity, the STM is able to make use of this transaction.
    If each field needs to be managed with field granularity, a more expensive one is used used.
<p>
    Another disadvantage of field granularity is that the total number of synchronization actions
    increases:
<ol>
    <li>more locks to release/acquire</li>
    <li>locks are hold for a longer period</li>
    <li>more conflict detecting needed</li>
    <li>more writes needed</li>
    <li>more reads needed</li>
    <li>etc</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The instrumentation for the AlphaStm is even able to prevent loading the tranlocal content of an object
    once it has been retrieved. All transactional instance method of a transactional object which really has state,
    or modified so that the tranlocal is passed as argument. So if you need to do a lot of 'this' calls on a
    transactional object, chances are high that instead of doing an ALOAD 0 -> GET_FIELD or ALOAD 0, value->PUT_FIELD
    is that an ALOAD N -> GET_FIELD or ALOAD N value-> PUTFIELD can be done. Making reads and writes almost as expensive
    as non transactional field read/writes.
</p>
That is why Multiverse instrumentation for the AlphaStm uses object granularity by default. And for Stm
implementation it doesn't managed of object or field granularity is used, since each managed reference
itself is a transactional object with a single managed field.

<h2 id="programmaticLong">13.6 ProgrammaticLong</h2>
The <a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/apidocs/org/multiverse/api/programmatic/ProgrammaticLong.html">ProgrammaticLong</a>
is not much different than the ProgrammaticReference, except that is optimized for storing
a long (or int, short, byte, char). It can be compared to the AtomicLong except that is can be used
inside transactions. The advantage of using a ProgrammaticLong is that you have access to the commutingInc
(needed for creating a well behaving size field in transactions for example) and that no unnecessary boxing
and autoboxing happens.

<h2 id="multiple.stm.instances">13.7 Multiple Stm instances</h2>
In some cases you might want to have multiple stm instances. Perhaps different configurations or you want to
prevent unwanted contention. E.g. stm's can suffer from contention caused by a shared structures like the
clock needed to prevent isolation issues. Having multiple instances are possible, but you need to be careful that
certain components don't look at the GlobalStmInstance if they need an Stm instance.
The TransactionTemplate should use an explicit TransactionFactory created by your stm. If this is forgotten,
the TransactionTemplate will make use of the
<a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/apidocs/org/multiverse/api/GlobalStmInstance.html">GlobalStmInstance</a>.
<p>
    It it also very important to realize that transactional objects created by different stm's
    can't be exchanged because you can get problems like from ClassCastExceptions to subtile isolation anomalies.
    The same Stm instance needs to be used that created the TransactionFactoryBuilder and the
    ProgrammaticReferenceFactoryBuilder. There is no detection or protection of transactional objects
    being exchanged between stm's. If this becomes an issue, it will be easy to add a 'stm' owner to
    each transactional object, but it will increase memory usage.
<p>
    If there really is a need for multiple stm instances, a ThreadLocalStm could be created for easy access
    instead of carrying it around all the time. The TransactionTemplate also needs to be enhanced to make use
    of this ThreadLocalStm.
<p>
    Using pre-instrumented code could be an issue since it relies on a GlobalStm (the instrumented code in the
    AlphaStm does since the ThreadFactories are expensive objects and created when the class is initialized and
    stored in a generated final static variable).
