<h1>Multiverse 0.5</h1>

Multiverse 0.5 was released at 2 May 2010 and contains the following features:
<ol>
    <li>Multiverse Compiler: responsible for compile-time instrumentation. The instrumentation architecture
        is now set up in such a way the the same mechanism can be used for the compiletime and runtime
        instrumentation
    </li>
    <li>New Transactional collections:
        <ul>
            <li>TransactionalReferenceArray</li>
            <li>TransactionalArrayList</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Transactions that only create new Transactional Objects and don't update existing transactional
        objects, have become a lot cheaper. They don't need to acquire/release their locks and they don't need
        to increase the shared clock.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many bytecode optimizations:
        <ul>
            <li>Inlining getters/setters: because additional code is generated, simple inlining of getters/setters
                could be obstructed in the JIT. That is why an explicit getter/setter inliner for managed fields
                is added to the Multiverse Compiler, that is applied before all other transformations.
            </li>
            <li>Staying inside transactional methods: the instrumentation generates additional methods
                for every transactional method. The original method is stripped from all logic which is replaced
                by transaction management logic. The original logic is moved to new synthetic methods. But because you
                know that once you enter such a method, the transaction management already is done, you can safely call
                other 'synthetic' methods that already have transaction management done.
            <li>Transactional this: transactional methods in Multiverse are modified, and in this case they
                are modified in such a way that the tranlocal of the 'this', is added to all transactional instance
                methods of that class. The advantage is that instead of going through a transaction to
                retrieve the tranlocal, it always will be available in a local variable. So a read/write
                on managed field of will be almost as fast as in uninstrumented code. And if a instance
                method calls another instance methods of itself, it can pass the tranlocal
                (doesn't need to be retrieved again from the transaction).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Spinning: in the 0.4 release when a transaction wants to to open a transactional object for reading
        or writing, and the object is locked (for committing), it fails immediately and is retried. With the
        0.5 release spinning is added to prevent failing immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalability improvements in the AlphaSTM by reducing lock time and removing unwanted cas
        instructions. Locks are now released as soon as the write has completed instead of of waiting
        for the whole transaction to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timed blocking transactions. In the 0.4 release it was only possible to do blocking operations that
        potentially block forever. With the timed blocking transaction it is now possible to configure a
        timeout.
    </li>
    <li>
        New integration API for JVM based languages that don't want to rely on the instrumentation,
        or on STM specifics implementation details. The references created by this API already contain
        optimizations that will be added to the instrumentation process of Multiverse 0.6. 'Atomic' getters
        (so setters that don't rely on a transaction) have the speed comparable to a volatile read. Atomic setters are a
        little bit
        more expensive. The idea is that if you can deal with relaxed consistency, they you can get the most
        out of performance. If a normal finds that no transaction is running, it will forward to the atomic
        version is one is available.
    </li>
    <li>
        Initial support for commuting operations. This was needed to have better scalable transactional
        data-structures because they won't conflict on the size field anymore. It currently is only accessible
        through the new Integration API, but will be made generally available in Multiverse in the near future.
    </li>
    <li>
        Configurable blocking transactions. This feature was added for environments that don't want to allow
        blocking transactions, but don't have control if a retry is done.
    </li>
    <li>
        Self learning transaction system based on speculative execution, is now able to detect when a transaction
        needs to be readonly or an update. The same goes for detecting if read tracking for blocking operations
        should be enabled. This means that these properties don't need to be specified explicitly by the developer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Guaranteed to work with the Sun 1.6 / IBM 1.6 / OpenJDK 1.7 (all tests are executed on the newest
        versions every night).
    </li>
