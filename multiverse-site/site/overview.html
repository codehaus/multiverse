<h1>Overview</h1>
Multiverse is a Java based
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_Memory">Software Transactional Memory</a> (STM)
implementation that wants to realize the following goals:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Seamless integration in the Java language:</b> done through annotations and bytecode instrumentation.
        For more information check the <a href="60second.html">60 Second guide to Multiverse</a> or
        check the <a href="documentationoverview.html">documentation overview</a>
        for a complete listing of guides/manuals and literature.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Language independent:</b> so it can be used without relying on instrumentation and therefore can
        easily be used with other languages that can run on the JVM like like Scala, Groovy or JRuby.
    <li>
        <b>Framework:</b> for different STM implementation. This makes it easy to experiment with new features
        or build a customized STM implementation.
    </li>
</ol>

        <b>2 May 2010: </b> release of <a href="0.5.release.html">Multiverse 0.5</a>. Support for compiletime
        instrumentation (Multiverse jar is pre-instrumented), new integration api to make integration in non
        Java languages easier. TransactionalArrayList/TransactionalReferenceArray, a lot of performance and
        scalability improvements, timed blocking calls and a lot of other small improvements.
    </li>

        <b>24 February 2010:</b> release of <a href="0.4.release.html">Multiverse 0.4</a>. Support for
        optional read tracking, writeskew prevention, deferred and compensating tasks, 2 phase commit,

        <b>10 January 2010:</b> moved from <a href="http://multiverse.googlecode.com">googlecode</a> to
        <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">Codehaus</a>. They provide a lot of Java licenses like my favorite
        IDE <a href="http://www.jetbrain.com">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and everything else you need like Git, Clover
        and Bamboo.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>1 December 2009:</b> Open Source license for Atlassian Clover. Although Cobertura does its job, it
        isn't as advanced as Clover.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>19 December 2009:</b> release of <a href="0.3.release.html">Multiverse 0.3</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>1 November 2009:</b> Open source licence for <a href="http://www.jprofiler.com">JProfiler 6</a>. Great
        performance tuning tool while developing.
