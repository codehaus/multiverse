<h1>Overview</h1>
Multiverse is a Java based
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_Memory">Software Transactional Memory</a> (STM)
implementation that wants to realize the following goals:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Language independent:</b> so it can be used without relying on instrumentation and therefore can
        easily be used with other languages that can run on the JVM like like Scala, Groovy or JRuby.
    <li>
        <b>Framework:</b> for different STM implementation. This makes it easy to experiment with new features
        or build a customized STM implementation.
    </li>
</ol>

        <b>10 January 2010:</b> moved from <a href="http://multiverse.googlecode.com">googlecode</a> to
        <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">Codehaus</a>. They provide a lot of Java licenses like my favorite
        IDE <a href="http://www.jetbrain.com">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and everything else you need like Git, Clover
        and Bamboo.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>1 December 2009:</b> Open Source license for Atlassian Clover. Although Cobertura does its job, it
        isn't as advanced as Clover.

        <b>1 November 2009:</b> Open source licence for <a href="http://www.jprofiler.com">JProfiler 6</a>. Great
        performance tuning tool while developing.
