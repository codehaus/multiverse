<h1>Setup Java Agent</h1>

If you want to make use of classes annotated with @TransactionObject or @TransactionalMethod, these classes need
to be instrumented.
<p/>
The setup of the Multiverse Javaagent:
<pre>
    java -javaagent:multiverse-alpha-javaagent-0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar YourMain
</pre>
Other libraries for Multiverse are not needed (everything is included in this jar). For the time being it only is
possible to do this through Java agent technology using load time instrumentation. In the near future a compiletime
instrumentation option will be provided.
<p/>
If you want to use Multiverse without the instrumentation, for example to integrate it in a different language, the
        Javaagent is not needed.
        
<p/>
Multiverse makes use of <a href="http://asm.ow2.org">ASM</a>, a powerful bytecode manipulation framework. And using
<a href="http://jarjar.googlecode.com">Jar Jar</a>, ASM is included in the multiverse-alpha-javaagent jar
and automatically refactored so that it is placed on a non conflicting package. This means that it doesn't matter
if ASM already is on the classpath or that a different version is used.
