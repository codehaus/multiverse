<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
One of the main goals of Multiverse is to seamlessly integrate in the Java language. This
can be done in 2 ways:
<ol>
    <li>javaagent: great for development purposes but undesirable in the production
        environment.
    </li>
    <li>compiletime instrumentation: sucks when using an ide, but great for production.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    But to make it possible that Multiverse can be used in an environment that doesn't
    want to rely on any form of instrumentation (static or dynamic), Multiverse 0.5
    gained the ProgrammaticReference api. The actual STM implementation doesn't care
    about annotations or instrumentation, it cares about objects that implement certain
    interfaces. This means that the Multiverse library can easily be integrated in other
    JVM based languages (Multiverse already is used in the <a href="http://www.akkasource.org/">Akka</a>
    project written in Scala). Both ways of using Multiverse are part of the
    <a href="missionstatement.html">Mission Statement</a>.
<p>
    The main Multiverse jar: Multerse-Alpha is a completely self contained jar that
    is <b>preinstrumented</b>, so you can make use of all the transactional datastructures like
    the TransactionalLinkedList or the TransactionalTreeMap without relying on
    instrumentation. It also means that it is possible to combine transactional
    datastructures written in different JVM based languages, in the same STM.
    So in theory a transaction started in Akka/Scala can participate in accessing
    datastructures written in Java or in JRuby.
<p>
    A short note on thread locals and global variables: some are used in Multiverse to
    make it easy to use. But it is no problem to become completely independent on these
    types of variables. The <tt>TransactionTemplate</tt> and the ProgrammaticReference
    also can be used with explicit provided references to the
    <tt>Transaction</tt> or <tt>Stm</tt>. The STM implementation itself doesn't
    depend on thread locals or global variables; they are only there to make the system
    easier to use.
<p>
    There are two ways to integrate Multiverse with your project:
<ol>
    <li><a href="#quick.solution">Easy solution</a> if you want to get up and running quickly. No instrumentation
        needed at all.
    </li>
    <li><a href="#complex.solution">Complex solution with improved performance</a> if you want improved performance. I
        would only start with this approach if you have already successfully tried the quick solution.
    </li>
</ol>
So if you think that your project could benefit from STM technology, I would be happy to help. The success of your
project also helps make Multiverse a success.

<h2 id="quick.solution">Quick solution</h2>
The easiest way to intregrate Multiverse in another language is to use a <tt>ProgrammaticReference</tt> API (introduced
in Multiverse 0.5) in combination with the <tt>TransactionalTemplate</tt>. The <tt>ProgrammaticReference</tt> is a
reference that can be used inside transactions, so you have all the isolation and atomicity functionality and blocking
operations also are not a problem.
E.g.
<pre>
  class Account {
        final static ProgrammaticReferenceFactory refFactory = GlobalStmInstance.getGlobalStmInstance().
            getProgrammaticReferenceFactoryBuilder().build();

        private final ProgrammaticReference&lt;Integer&gt; balance = refFactory.createAtomic();

        public int getBalance(){
            return balance.get();
        }

        public void setBalance(int newBalance){
            balance.set(newBalance);
        }
  }
</pre>
This account is an example of a transactional object with managed fields. The advantage of
using the ProgrammaticReference api, is that you are not dependant on a specific
Multiverse STM implementation. This makes it easy to switch STM implementations without
the need to change code on your side. Next to the ProgrammaticReference there also
is a ProgrammaticLong (that includes the commuting inc operation, nice for collection
size field).
<p>
    The <tt>ProgrammaticReference</tt> contains different sets of methods for different purposes;
    some require a transaction (so you need to pass a transaction on from the outside), some
    start their own if one isn't running. Some of them are meant to make the
    <tt>ProgrammaticReference</tt> easy to use, some are meant to give you perfect control
    on transactional behavior. The ProgrammaticReference also contains atomic methods, that
    completely ignore any current running transaction. These calls are very fast (in
    case of an atomicGet only a volatile read needs to be done, the atomicSet/atomicCompareAndSet
    methods are a little bit more expensive.
<p>
    The <tt>TransactionTemplate</tt> contains the transaction handling logic like starting, retrying, blocking,
    committing or aborting, e.g.:
<pre>
    public void transfer(final Account from, final Account to, final int amount){
        new TransactionTemplate(){
            public Object void execute(Transaction tx){
                from.set(from.get()-amount);
                to.set(to.get()+amount);
            }
        }.execute();
    }
</pre>
For more information check the <a href="manual-templates.html#transactiontemplate">manual</a>.
<p>
    If you want to get the most ouf of the performance, it is important that you reuse
    the transactionFactory builder e.g:
<pre>
    //
    final static TransactionFactory txFactory = getGlobalStmInstance().getTransactionFactoryBuilder()
        .setReadonly(false)
        .setFamilyName("transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount")
        .setAutomaticReadTracking(...)
        .setMoreProperties(...)
        .build();

    public void transfer(final Account from, final Account to, final int amount){
        new TransactionTemplate(txFactory){
            public Object void execute(Transaction tx){
                from.set(from.get()-amount);
                to.set(to.get()+amount);
            }
        }.execute();
    }
</pre>
If you don't do this, you won't give the txFactory any chance to learn (see the setSpeculativeConfiguration on
the TransactionFactoryBuilder for more details). Settings like readonly, automatic readtracking
and optimal transaction length can be infered at runtime. So no need to bother a user with
it in most cases. In the future more selflearning optimizations will be added through this
mechanism.
<p>
    If you control these structures from your language extension or
    library, you can make use of all the functionality in Multiverse (the Multiverse STM sees no difference).
    The quick solution is just as powerful as the complex solution, it only is slower. Both
    mechanisms can be combined with each other (from the STM point of view there is
    no difference).

<h2 id="complex.solution">Complex solution with improved performance</h2>
Although the <tt>AlphaRef</tt>/
<tt>TransactionalTemplate</tt> combination works well, there is a considerable amount of overhead caused by all the
object creation, and because there is extra indirection between the reference and its value.
Using instrumentation a lot of this overhead can be removed:
<ol>
    <li>Inlining the transaction logic in the method and also reducing the need to box/unbox primitives returned by a
        method. Perhaps that the JIT (already) is able to do it, but in this case we are 100% certain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reducing stress on the transaction by using object granularity instead of field granularity (lower memory
        usage and commits/aborts are a lot faster). Multiverse uses different transactions based on the expected
        transaction length (Multiverse learns from a running system). In the future a lot more of this intelligence
        will be added.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cheaper managed reference field access: instead of retrieving the tranlocal (transaction local content of
        a transactional object) for each and every write, the tranlocal for the 'this' will be added as extra
        argument to each instance method of a transactional object. So accessing fields are not much more expensive
        then they originally were (OK, you need to push more stuff on the stack and the JIT could have a harder time
        unleashing all its magic because the code is less standard). If other transactional objects are accessed more
        than
        once the instrumentation could decide to optimize this as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cheaper transaction reference access. instead of accessing the ThreadLocalTransaction,
        it also can be added as argument to each method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completely bypassing transactional logic, you can also optimize transactional methods that call other
        transactional methods by moving the call from the original method to an enhanced version that already
        expects a transaction to have been started.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completely inlining the transaction, so that very simple methods like getters/setters that don't rely on having
        an explicit transaction object become even cheaper.
    </li>
</ol>
At the moment, not all optimizations are realized, but in the future they will be and perhaps new optimizations will be found and added.
Although software-based Transactional Memory isn't as fast as hardware-based TM, it would be a shame
if a lot of quick wins are ignored. Personally I hope that we move to a hybrid approach; where the low level
reading/writing/conflict-detection is done by hardware, and more advanced functionality like 2 phase commit or
pre/post commit tasks can be added on top by the software.
<p>
    In the coming release of Multiverse I'll make sure that the instrumentation part of Multiverse
    can also be hooked up to an already existing compiler. So if you make sure that the objects you want to be
    transactional (i.e. managed
    by the STM) and that the bytecode for these classes contains the extra annotations the Multiverse
    instrumentation will make sure that the required transformations (including optimizations) are done. This prevents
    you from doing a lot of additional hard work and having to choose a specific STM implementation.

<h2 id="exception.handling">Exception Handling</h2>
Multiverse uses a org.multiverse.api.exceptions.ControlFlowError to rely on the transaction template
and the instrumentation to do it works. Other exceptions like the ReadConflict, WriteConflict
etc extend from his ControlFlowError. So as long as you don't catch this error in
your integration, you are alright. If you do catch this error, the transactiontemplate
will not work as expected.
