<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Seamless integration in Java:</b> using annotations in combination with instrumentation (so you are
        not forced to extend classes or implement interfaces). Most transaction features can be configured through
        the annotations. The instrumentation process can be:
        <ol>
            <li>runtime: using the Multiverse Javaagent</li>
            <li>compiletime: using the Multiverse Compiler</li>
            <li>any mix of runtime and compiletime instrumentation: useful when you are developing</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Independent of Java language:</b> so it can be used in other languages running on the JVM like
        Scala or Groovy. Specially for environments that don't want to rely on instrumentation, a direct api to the
        stm, the transaction and reference factories are provided. This api doesn't depend on a specific Multiverse
        STM implementation.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Object and field level granularity:</b> the main STM implementation, called the AlphaStm is able to
        deal with object and field level granularity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Only transactional access possible:</b> prevents having to deal with accessing transactional
        objects without a transaction.
    </li>
    <li><b>Different transaction modes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>read tracking update transaction:</b> the work horse that is able to do writes and
                participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
            <li><b>non read tracking update transaction:</b> consumes less resources than the read tracking version,
                but can't participate in blocking transactions or prevent write skew problems.
            </li>
            <li><b>read tracking readonly transaction:</b> the standard transaction implementation for readonly
                transaction. It is perfect serialized but can't participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
            <li><b>non read tracking readonly transaction:</b> consumes more resources than the non read tracking
                version, but is able to participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transaction lifecycle listener:</b> so that compensating or deferred actions can be executed when a
        transaction aborts or commits.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Optional write skew prevention:</b> makes is possible to create truly serialized transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Blocking transactions:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>retry primitive:</b></li>
            <li><b>orelse primitive:</b></li>
            <li><b>interruptible transactions:</b></li>
            <li><b>non blocking transactions:</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transactional collections:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>TransactionalLinkedList:</b> general purpose linked list that also can be used as BlockingQueue and
                BlockingDeque implementation.
            </li>
            <li><b>TransactionalArrayList:</b> transactional version of the java.util.ArrayList</li>
            <li><b>TransactionalReferenceArray:</b> transactional version of the
                java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReferenceArray
            </li>
        </ul>
        In the near future other implementations will be added (TreeMap/HashMap,TreeSet/HashSet etc).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transactional references and primitives</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>TransactionalReference:</b> makes it possible to work with managed references. This
                looks a lot like the approach other STM implementations take like Clojure.
            </li>
            <li><b>Transactional primitive:</b> like the TransactionalInteger and TransactionalBoolean that
                behave like transactional references but without creating a lot of small wrapper objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Templates:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>TransactionTemplate:</b> a template that can be used as an alternative to using
                instrumentation.
            </li>
            <li><b>OrElseTemplate:</b> a template that can be used to make use of the orelse primitive.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>TransactionalExecutor:</b> a Transaction implementation of the
        ThreadPoolExecutor from Java that is able to participate in transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>2 Phase commit:</b> to make it possible to combine transactions executing on different
        transactional resources, or even for combining the commit/abort atomic on different transactions
        on the same stm.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Learning Stm:</b> that learns by runtime transaction analysis and chooses better performing
        or behaving transactions. Atm it learns about when a transaction should be an update, when it needs
        read tracking and which type of transaction is the best fit for a certain situation (cheap transaction
        implementations for small transactions, and more expensive implementations for bigger transactions).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>No special JVM needed:</b> Multiverse runs on a standard Java 6+ JVM. Every night all the tests are
        executed in the newest JVM's of Sun(Oracle), IBM and the OpenJDK.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Not messing other classes:</b> Multiverse will only instrument the classes that are explicitly defined
        as needing instrumentation. So Multiverse will not mess with your other classes (like those of the JDK).
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Planned features</h2>
Of course there are also a lot of features in the pipeline. The most important ones are:
<ol>
    <li><b>Persistence:</b> for making committed transactions durable. This should be mostly transparent
        to the developer.
    </li>
    <li><b>Distributed STM:</b> so load can be spread out over a cluster of machines and it also is useful for
        realizing failover.
    </li>
    <li><b>Contention management:</b> to have more control on liveness issues like livelocking and starvation.</li>
    <li><b>More collections:</b> like HashMap, TreeMap, SkipList, Tries etc</li>
    <li><b>Improved performance:</b> there is a lot of room for performance improvements by optimizing the
        bytecode.
    </li>
</ol>
