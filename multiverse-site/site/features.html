<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Independent of Java language:</b> so it can be used in other languages running on the JVM like
        Scala or Groovy. Specially for environments that don't want to rely on instrumentation, a direct api to the
        stm, the transaction and reference factories are provided. This api doesn't depend on a specific Multiverse
        STM implementation.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Object and field level granularity:</b> the main STM implementation, called the AlphaStm is able to
        deal with object and field level granularity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Only transactional access possible:</b> prevents having to deal with accessing transactional
        objects without a transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Different transaction modes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>read tracking update transaction:</b> the work horse that is able to do writes and
                participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
            <li><b>non read tracking update transaction:</b> consumes less resources than the read tracking version,
                but can't participate in blocking transactions or prevent write skew problems.
            </li>
            <li><b>read tracking readonly transaction:</b> the standard transaction implementation for readonly
                transaction. It is perfect serialized but can't participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
            <li><b>non read tracking readonly transaction:</b> consumes more resources than the non read tracking
                version, but is able to participate in blocking transactions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transaction lifecycle listener:</b> so that compensating or deferred actions can be executed when a
        transaction aborts or commits.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Optional write skew prevention:</b> makes is possible to create truly serialized transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Blocking transactions:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>retry primitive:</b></li>
            <li><b>orelse primitive:</b></li>
            <li><b>interruptible transactions:</b></li>
            <li><b>non blocking transactions:</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transactional references and primitives</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>TransactionalReference:</b> makes it possible to work with managed references. This
                looks a lot like the approach other STM implementations take like Clojure.
            </li>
            <li><b>Transactional primitive:</b> like the TransactionalInteger and TransactionalBoolean that
                behave like transactional references but without creating a lot of small wrapper objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>2 Phase commit:</b> to make it possible to combine transactions executing on different
        transactional resources, or even for combining the commit/abort atomic on different transactions
        on the same stm.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Learning Stm:</b> that learns by runtime transaction analysis and chooses better performing
        or behaving transactions. Atm it learns about when a transaction should be an update, when it needs
        read tracking and which type of transaction is the best fit for a certain situation (cheap transaction
        implementations for small transactions, and more expensive implementations for bigger transactions).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>No special JVM needed:</b> Multiverse runs on a standard Java 6+ JVM. Every night all the tests are
        executed in the newest JVM's of Sun(Oracle), IBM and the OpenJDK.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Not messing other classes:</b> Multiverse will only instrument the classes that are explicitly defined
        as needing instrumentation. So Multiverse will not mess with your other classes (like those of the JDK).
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Planned features</h2>
Of course there are also a lot of features in the pipeline. The most important ones are:
<ol>
    <li><b>Persistence:</b> for making committed transactions durable. This should be mostly transparent
        to the developer.
    </li>
    <li><b>Distributed STM:</b> so load can be spread out over a cluster of machines and it also is useful for
        realizing failover.
    </li>
    <li><b>Contention management:</b> to have more control on liveness issues like livelocking and starvation.</li>
    <li><b>More collections:</b> like HashMap, TreeMap, SkipList, Tries etc</li>
    <li><b>Improved performance:</b> there is a lot of room for performance improvements by optimizing the
        bytecode.
    </li>
</ol>
