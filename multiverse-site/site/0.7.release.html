<h2>Multiverse 0.7</h2>

Multiverse 0.7 was released at 1 January 2011 and was a total rewrite from the 0.6 release. The main features are:
<ol>
    <li><b>Removal of the central clock</b>. The STM design before 0.7 was based on MVCC (TL2 to be more specific) and
        although it is really amazing, and readonly transactions can be made really cheap, update transaction still need to contend for the
        central clock to increment. There are some optimizations that can be applied to remove contention on this clock, but the clock
        is still required. The STM of Multiverse 0.7 is based around the idea of the SkySTM where no central clock is needed.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Isolation Levels</b>. Multiverse 0.7 supports the following isolation levels:
        <ol>
            <li>read committed: where a transaction will only see committed state, but no other consistency guarantees
                are provided. Read committed isolation level
                allows for much higher concurrency (it won't fail unlike the other isolation levels) and therefor scales
                better, at the cost of reduced consistency. The
                dirty read isolation level is not supported since a transaction will never see changes made by another
                transaction.
            </li>
            <li>repeatable read:</li>
            <li>snapshot: the Oracle version of the Serialized isolation level</li>
            <li>serialized: provides a truly serialized execution of transaction where the writeskew problem is not allowed.
            explicit support for enabling/disabling the writeskew problem from happening has been removed</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Pessimistic locking: </b> to compensate for the optimistic behavior STM's normally provide. It can be done on
        the reference level using ensure/privatize,
        but can also be done on the transaction level using the following pessimistic lock levels:
        <ol>
            <li>None: default. Nothing is locked during the execution of the transaction.</li>
            <li>Ensure writes: when this pessimistic lock level is used, you essentially get the same behavior as in the
            Oracle database, where each update/delete/insert automatically is locked for the remaining duration of the
            transaction.</li>
            <li>Ensure reads</li>
            <li>Privatize writes</li>
            <li>Privatize reads</li>
        </ol>
        Other added features are accessing the current locking status of a reference (to see if it ensured/privatized by
        itself or by others).
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Deferred ensure: </b> makes it possible to deal optimistically with the writeskew problem on the ref level without causing
        overhead on all ref/transactional objects.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Improved performance: </b> a lot of effort was spend on improving the performance of the STM. One of the big
        improvements was the removal of all unwanted
        object creation by adding an object pool to each transaction (which also can be reused).
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Atomic operations on refs</b> the api of the references has been improved greatly and one of the new features is support
        for atomic operations. Atomic operations are easier to do and a lot faster and can be a better solution than using a transaction
        where only one ref is updated. The following atomic operations are available:
        <ol>
            <li>atomicGet</li>
            <li>atomicWeakGet</li>
            <li>atomicGetAndSet</li>
            <li>atomicSetAndGet</li>
            <li>atomicAlterAndGet</li>
            <li>atomicGetAndAlter</li>
            <li>atomicCompareAndSet</li>
            <li>atomicIsNull</li>
            <li>atomicIsFree</li>
            <li>atomicIsPrivatized</li>
            <li>atomicIsEnsured</li>
            <li>atomicIncrementAndGet</li>
            <li>atomicGetAndIncrement</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Alter</b>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Commute:</b>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Transaction.abortOnly</b>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Removal of functionality:</h3>
Some features have been removed from the 0.7 release:
<ol>
    <ol>Instrumentation: will be added in the future again</ol>
    <ol>TransactionalExecutor: will be added in the future</ol>
    <ol>Transactional datastructures: will be added in the 0.8 release</ol>
    <ol>Groovy support: we are working on integrating Multiverse directly with Groovy/GPars</ol>
    <ol>Scala support: all Scala support is done through the Akka project and we are planning to provide an implementation that implements the Scala STM API</ol>
</ol>
