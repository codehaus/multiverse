<h2 id="introduction">12.1 Introduction</h2>
The Multiverse Runtime contains the global stm instance. It is possible to have multiple stm instances in the
same java process (even in the same classloader), but if you are using the instrumented functionality
or not explicitly using an STM instance, the transaction will make use of the GlobalStmInstance (so one
unique instance for every classloader). Default the AlphaStm (the main Stm implementation of Multiverse) is
loaded and configured for performance. In most cases you can completely ignore this chapter.

<h2 id="configuration">12.2 Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The GlobalStmInstance can be configured using the org.multiverse.api.GlobalStmInstance.factoryMethod key
    in the System properties. The value should point to a static no argument method that returns an Stm
    instance. This property can be set from the commandline like this:
<pre>
    java ..... -Dorg.multiverse.api.GlobalStmInstance.factoryMethod=YourStm.createMethod ...
</pre>
If you want to reconfigure the Multiverse AlphaStm:
<ol>
    <li>create a static factory method where the AlphaStm instance if build</li>
    <li>set the org.multiverse.api.GlobalStmInstance.factoryMethod property</li>
</ol>
<p>

<h2 id="warning">12.3 Warning</h2>
If you have created a different Stm implementation, you need to make sure that you are using the right
Instrumentor in the Multiverse Javaagent or Multiverse Compiler because the instrumentation process is
stm specific (this provides a lot of design and optimization freedom).
<p>
    You also need to watch out for classes that are instrumented with the Multiverse Compiler
    with a different Instrumentor. If this happens the Multiverse Compiler and Javaagent
    will detect this an throw a org.multiverse.instrumentation.CompileException.

<h2 id="design.rationale">12.4 Design rationale</h2>
In most cases I would have been against fiddling with System.properties; an IOC container like Spring
or Guice normally takes care of initializing dependencies. But because instrumented classes could depend
on a initialized GlobalStmInstance once they are loaded (for the AlphaStm the transactionfactory
is initialized by accessing the GlobalStmInstance and stored in a generated static variable),
we can't rely on some container because that possibly is loaded later.
