<h2 id="introduction">9.1 Introduction</h2>
With the 2 phase commit it is possible commit multiple transactions atomically and isolated. The 2 phase commit
has 2 stages:
<ol>
    <li>let all the participants (cohorts) prepare</li>
    <li>let all the participants commit</li>
</ol>
If all cohorts agree, all transactions can be committed. If one of the cohorts doesn't agree, all transactions are
aborted.

<h2 id="conceptually.flawed">9.2 Conceptually flawed</h2>
It is important to realize that the 2 phase commit conceptually is flawed. It is possible that the system gets
in an inconsistent state after all transactions succesfully prepared and before all transactions
committed the changes. If one of the transactions crash, not all changes have been made final.
<p>
    For in memory transactions in Multiverse this won't be a big issue issue, because the only way for a transaction
    to crash is when it runs into a system error (like running out of memory), or a programming error or when the jvm
    is killed (for example when the server crashes).

<h2 id="transaction.prepare">9.3 The Transaction prepare() method</h2>
The Transaction interfaces exposes a prepare method that makes it possible to let Multiverse participate in
2 phase commits. It can be used to combine Multiverse with another transactional resource (for example
changes made on a database using a sql transaction). But it also can be used to execute multiple
transactions in Multiverse.
<p>
    The prepare method guarantees that if the successfully completed, that the needed resources are locked. And if the
    prepare method throws an exception, it guarantees that all resources have been released and the transaction
    automatically is put in the aborted state.
<p>
    After the prepare is called, it isn't possible to do access methods apart from the commit/abort that do changes.
    So opening transactional objects for reading/writing is not allowed. If this happens, a
    PreparedTransactionException is thrown.
<p>
    The prepare method is idempotent, so it doesn't matter if it is called more than once. If the prepare method is
    called while the the transaction is aborted or committed, a DeadTransactionException is thrown. At the moment
    there is no support for letting Multiverse transactions do a 2phase commit with other types of transactions, but
    in the future JTA/XA connections will be provided.

<h3 id="important.of.commit.or.abort">9.3.1 Importance of commit or abort</h3>
When a transaction contains dirty transactional objects, these transactional objects are locked so that other
transactions can't make conflicting writes after the prepare successfully is called. This means that while these
transactional objects are locked, other transactions can't make use of these transactional objects. So as long as the
transaction is not aborted or committed, these objects are going to cause a lot of read/write  conflicts. Therefor it
is important that a prepared transaction is committed or aborted as soon as possible.

<h2 id="commitbarriers">9.4 CommitBarriers</h2>
A barrier is a synchronization structure that is closed in the beginning; this can be used by threads to block.
And once some kind of condition has been met, the barrier is openend and the blocked threads can continue. The 2 phase
commit functionality in Multiverse is also based on barriers and can be used to atomically commit or abort
a group of Transactions. Currently there are 2 types of CommitBarriers:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#vetocommitbarrier">VetoCommitBarrier:</a> where 1 transaction can commit all others.</li>
    <li><a href="#countdowncommitbarrier">CountDownCommitBarrier:</a> if the commit of the pending transactions
        is based on the number of returned parties.
    </li>
</ul>
Both implementations are not resetable, unlike the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html">CyclicBarrier</a>. It could
be that this behavior is added in the future when it is really needed.

<h3 id="vetocommitbarrier">9.4.1 VetoCommitBarrier</h3>
The org.multiverse.twophase.VetoCommitBarrier is a synchronization structure that can be compared to a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html">CountDownLatch</a> and
coordinates prepare and commit/abort, so this doesn't need to be accessed directly.
<p>
    The VetoCommitBarrier.awaitCommit method is responsible for preparing the transaction, and suspending the
    calling thread as long as CommitBarrier is not committed/aborted. If the transaction already is aborted or
    committed, this method will throw an exception. If the transaction already is prepared, the thread blocks.
    And if the transaction is active, it is prepared. If preparing succeeds, the thread

    is put to sleep and can wait for the commit/abort. If the prepare fails, the transaction is aborted, but
    the CommitGroup isn't aborted. This is because reexecuting the transaction could lead to a successful
    execution the next time.
<p>
    The CommitGroup can be committed/aborted in 2 ways:
<ol>
    <li>with a transaction; by calling the CommitGroup.commit(Transaction) method.</li>
    <li>without a transaction; by calling CommitGroup.commit() or CommitGroup.abort().</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This is an example where a CommitGroup is used to coordinate the commit of 2 threads.
<pre>
    import static org.multiverse.api.ThreadLocalTransaction.getThreadLocalTransaction;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.commitbarriers.CountDownCommitBarrier;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;

    public class Foo{

        private final TransactionalInteger ref1 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final TransactionalInteger ref2 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final VetoCommitBarrier barrier = new VetoCommitBarrier();

        public void foo(){
            IncThread t1 = new IncThread(ref1);
            IncThread t2 = new IncThread(ref2);

            t1.start();
            t2.start();

            ..sleep some

            barrier.vetoCommit();
        }

        class IncThread extends Thread{

            private final TransactionalInteger ref;

            public IncThread(TransactionalInteger ref){
                this.ref = ref;
            }

            @TransactionalMethod
            public void run(){
                ref.inc();
                barrier.joinCommitUninterruptibly(getThreadLocalTransaction());
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
In this example the vetoCommit doesn't accept a Transaction, but there also is a vetoCommit method
that accepts a Transaction and adds this transaction to the group of pending transactions, and then
commits the CommitGroup so that all pending transactions commit.
<p>
    It is important that the commitGroup.awaitCommit method call in the IncThread.run method, is the last call of the
    method that used the transaction. If it isn't the last call, the already committed or aborted transaction
    could be used by transactional objects. When they discover that the transaction is dead, a DeadTransaction
    is thrown.

<h3 id="countdowncommitbarrier">9.4.2 CountdownCommitBarrier</h3>
The CountdownCommitBarrier is a CommitBarrier that looks a lot like the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html">CountdownLatch</a> where
the barrier is openend (so all transaction commit) once all parties have arrived.

<pre>

    import static org.multiverse.api.ThreadLocalTransaction.getThreadLocalTransaction;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;
    import org.multiverse.commitbarriers.CountDownCommitBarrier;

    public class Foo{

        private final TransactionalInteger ref1 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final TransactionalInteger ref2 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final CountDownCommitBarrier barrier = new CountDownCommitBarrier(2);

        public void foo(){
            IncThread t1 = new IncThread(ref1);
            IncThread t2 = new IncThread(ref2);

            t1.start();
            t2.start();
        }

        class IncThread extends Thread{

            private final TransactionalInteger ref;

            public IncThread(TransactionalInteger ref){
                this.ref = ref;
            }

            @TransactionalMethod
            public void run(){
                ref.inc();
                barrier.joinCommitUninterruptibly(getThreadLocalTransaction());
            }
        }
    }    
</pre>
In this example a CountDownCommitBarrier with count 2 is created, and commits after both IncThreads have
joined the commit. The CountDownCommitBarrier contains a whole set of similar joinCommit methods that differ in
beeing capable of dealing with timeouts, being interruptible etc. Using the countDown() method it also
is possible to do do a countDown (so return a party) without relying on a Transaction to join.

<h3 id="timeout">9.4.3 Timeout</h3>
It is possible to let a VetoCommitBarrier or the CountdownCommitBarrier timeout; after the timeout has occurred, the
commitbarrier is aborted (unless it already has been aborted or committed). The timeout can be set using
the setTimeout method, example:
<pre>
    CountdownCommitBarrier barrier = new CountdownCommitBarrier(10);
    barrier.setTimeout(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
</pre>
In this case the CountdownCommitBarrier will abort after 1 second.
<p>
    Default all the CountdownCommitBarrier make use of a shared
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html">ScheduledExecutorService</a>
    to schedule the timeout on. This is done to make the api convenient to use and the CommitBarrier cheap (since
    not each and every CommitBarrier needs its own ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor. But in some cases a shared executor
    is undesirable because the abort is expensive (for example because the Transaction or CommitBarrier have
    expensive onAbort operations
<p>
    That is why a new instance can be set using the setScheduledExecutorService method. It is important to
    realize that this method should be called before calling the setTimeout method because the latter will use
    the current ScheduledExecutorService for scheduling the timeout.

<h3 id="onabort.or.oncommit.tasks">9.4.4 onAbort/onCommit tasks</h3>
It is possible to execute additional logic after the CommitBarrier commits or aborts. This can be done using the
registerOnCommitTask and registerOnAbortTask methods on the CommitBarrier. The logic will be executed on the
thread that caused the commit or abort of the CommitBarrier. An example:

<pre>
    CountdownCommitBarrier barrier = new CountDownCommitBarrier();
    barrier.registerOnCommitTask(
        new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                System.out.println("done");
            }
        }
    )
</pre>
Or when the CommitBarrier aborts:
<pre>
    CountdownCommitBarrier barrier = new CountDownCommitBarrier();
    barrier.registerOnAbortTask(
        new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                System.out.println("done");
            }
        }
    )
</pre>
The registerOnAbortTask and registerOnCommitTask throw an CommitBarrierOpenException if the CommitBarrier already is
aborted or committed.
