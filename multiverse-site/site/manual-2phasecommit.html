<h2 id="introduction">9.1 Introduction</h2>
With the 2 phase commit it is possible execute multiple transactions atomically and isolated. The 2 phase commit
has 2 stages:
<ol>
    <li>let all the participants (cohorts) prepare</li>
    <li>let all the participants commit</li>
</ol>
If all cohorts agree, all transactions can be committed. If one of the cohorts doesn't agree, all transactions are
aborted.

<h2 id="conceptually.flawed">9.2 Conceptually flawed</h2>
It is important to realize that the 2 phase commit conceptually is flawed. It is possible that the system gets
in an inconsistent state after all transactions succesfully prepared to commit and before all transactions
committed the changes. If one of the transactions crach, not all changes have been made final. For in memory
transactions in Multiverse this won't be an issue because the only way for a transaction to crash is when
it runs into a system error (like running out of memory), or a programming error or when the jvm is killed
(for example when the server crashes).

<h2 id="transaction.prepare">9.3 The Transaction prepare() method</h2>
The Transaction interfaces exposes a prepare method that makes it possible to let Multiverse participate in
2 phase commits. It can be used to combine Multiverse with another transactional resource (for example
changes made on a database using a sql transaction). But it also can be used to execute multiple
transactions in Multiverse.
<p/>
The prepare method guarantees that if the successfully completed, that the needed resources are locked. And if the
prepare method throws an exception, it guarantees that all resources have been released and the transaction
automatically is put in the aborted state.
<p/>
After the prepare is called, it isn't possible to do access methods apart from the commit/abort that do changes.
So opening transactional objects for reading/writing is not allowed. If this happens, a
PreparedTransactionException is thrown.
<p/>
The prepare method is idempotent, so it doesn't matter if it is called more than once. If the prepare method is called
while the the transaction is aborted or committed, a DeadTransactionException is thrown.

<h3 id="important.of.commit.or.abort">9.3.1 Importance of commit or abort</h3>
When a transaction has changes on transactional objects that need to be written, these transactional
objects are locked so that other transactions can't make conflicting writes after the prepare successfully
is called. This means that while these transactional objects are locked, other transactions can't make
use of these transactional objects. So while the transaction as long as the transaction is not aborted
or committed, these objects are going to cause a lot of read/write conflicts.

<h3 id="xa.protocol">9.3.2 XA protocol</h3>
At the moment no other 2 phase commit functionality is provided, but this is expected for the future. One of the
things that probably is going to be added is some form of XA-support.

<h2 id="commitgroup">9.3 CommitGroup</h2>
The org.multiverse.api.CommitGroup is a synchronization structure that can be compared to a countdownlatch
and coordinates prepare and commit/abort, so this doesn't need to be accessed directly.
<p/>
The CommitGroup.awaitCommit method is responsible for preparing the transaction to commit and suspending the
calling thread as long as CommitGroup is not committed/aborted. If the transaction already is aborted or
committed, this method will throw an exception. If the transaction already is prepared, they transaction
is put to sleep. And if the transaction is active, it is prepared. If preparing succeeds, the thread
is put to sleep and can wait for the commit/abort. If the prepare fails, the transaction is aborted, but
the CommitGroup isn't aborted. This is because reexecuting the transaction could lead to a successfull
execution the next time.
<p/>
The CommitGroup can be committed/aborted in 2 ways:
<ol>
    <li>with a transaction; by calling the CommitGroup.commit(Transaction) method.</li>
    <li>without a transaction; by calling CommitGroup.commit() or CommitGroup.abort().</li>
</ol>

<p/>
This is an example where a CommitGroup is used to coordinate the commit of 2 threads.
<pre>
    import static org.multiverse.api.ThreadLocalTransaction.getThreadLocalTransaction;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.TransactionalInteger;
    import org.multiverse.util.CommitGroup;

    public class Foo{

        private final TransactionalInteger ref1 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final TransactionalInteger ref2 = new TransactionalInteger();
        private final CommitGroup commitGroup = new CommitGroup();

        public void foo(){
            IncThread t1 = new IncThread(ref1);
            IncThread t2 = new IncThread(ref2);

            t1.start();
            t2.start();

            commitGroup.commit();
        }

        class IncThread extends Thread{

            private final TransactionalInteger ref;

            public IncThread(TransactionalInteger ref){
                this.ref = ref;
            }

            @TransactionalMethod
            public void run(){
                ref.inc();
                commitGroup.awaitCommit(getThreadLocalTransaction());
            }
        }
    }

</pre>
It is important that the commitGroup.awaitCommit method call in the IncThread.run method, is the last call of the
method that used the transaction. If it isn't the last call, the already committed or aborted transaction
could be used by transactional objects when they discover that the transaction is dead, a DeadTransaction
is thrown.

<p/>
It is important the the CommitGroup is aborted/committed in the end. If it is open for too long, the transactional
objects locked by the prepared transactions, are not usable and all thread wanting to access these transactional
objects could run into problems.
