For a more thorough explanation of Multiverse and how to configure it, check check out one of the following
manuals.
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="manual.html">Reference Manual:</a></b> all you need to know to use Multiverse.
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="architecture.html">Architecture:</a></b> contain an overview of the architectural concepts

        the Multiverse Javaagent
    </li>
</ol>

And don't be scared to check out the Javadoc and sourcecode. Helping to understand the source, also helps to
understand how to use Multiverse more effectivly or how to extend it.

<h2 id="recommended.papers">Recommended Papers</h2>
A lot of research has been done on transactional memory by a lot of very smart people. Multiverse relies on a lot of
concepts and techniques discovered and invented by these people. This is a listing of the most influencal papers for
Multiverse.
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Locking II:</a></b>contains a lot of information about the general principles
        behind the AlphaStm implementation (the main STM implementation of Multiverse)
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Boosting: </a></b></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="recommended.books">Recommended Books</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Information Systems</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Memory</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</a></b> not only contains a lot of information about
        the theories behind concurrent programming, but also has a chapter about Software Transactional Memory
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Concurrent Programming in Java</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">Java Concurrency in Practice</a></b> 'the' book about practical concurrent programming
        in Java.
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Expert Oracle Database Architecture: 9i and 10g Programming</a></b> or
        <b><a href="">Expert One on One - Oracle</a></b> written by Thomas Kyte. These books contain a lot of
        information
        about low level techniques used in databases but also provide a lot of information about a very scalable
        concurrency approach called: Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) that is also used in MySQL (with InnoDB)
        and Postgresql. Multiverse applies the general principles of MVCC (hence the name Multiverse).
