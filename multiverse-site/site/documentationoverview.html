        <b><a href="flyingstart.html">Flying start:</a></b> contains a completely working example based on Maven
        This project is very useful if you want to experiment without wasting a lot of time on setting up the
        environment (including javaagent) by hand.
    </li -->
    <li><b><a href="otherjvmlanguages.html">Multiverse without instrumentation:</a></b> describes how to use
        Multiverse without relying on instrumentation; useful if you want to integrate Multiverse
        with a language other than Java.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="alpha-instrumentation.html">Alpha instrumentation:</a></b> describes how the instrumentation
        (and the optimizations) of the main STM implementation of Multiverse: AlphaStm.

<h2 id="reference.manual">Multiverse 0.5 Reference and API</h2>
For a more thorough explanation of Multiverse and how to configure it, check out one of the following
manuals.
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="manual.html">Reference Manual:</a></b> all you need to know to use Multiverse.
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="architecture.html">Architecture:</a></b> an overview of the architectural concepts
        behind Multiverse.
    </li>
    <!-- li><b><a href="setup-javaagent.html">Setup Java Agent:</a></b> information about how to configure
        the Multiverse Javaagent
    </li -->
</ol>

And don't be scared to check out the Javadoc and source code. Understanding the source also helps to
understand how to use Multiverse more effectivly or how to extend it.

<h2 id="recommended.papers">Recommended Papers</h2>
A lot of research has been done on transactional memory by many very smart people. Multiverse relies on a lot of the
concepts and techniques discovered and invented by them. This is a listing of the most influencal papers for
Multiverse.
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Locking II:</a></b> a lot of information about the general principles
        behind the AlphaStm implementation (the main STM implementation of Multiverse)
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Boosting: </a></b> <em>TODO</em></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="recommended.books">Recommended Books</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Information Systems</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">Transactional Memory</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</a></b> not only contains a lot of information about
        the theories behind concurrent programming, but also has a chapter about Software Transactional Memory
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Concurrent Programming in Java</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="">Java Concurrency in Practice</a></b> <u>the</u> book about practical concurrent programming
        in Java.
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="">Expert Oracle Database Architecture: 9i and 10g Programming</a></b> or
        <b><a href="">Expert One on One - Oracle</a></b> written by Thomas Kyte. These books contain a lot of
        information
        about low level techniques used in databases but also provide a lot of information about a very scalable
        concurrency approach called: Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) that is also used in MySQL (with InnoDB)
        and Postgresql. Multiverse applies the general principles of MVCC (hence the name Multiverse).
