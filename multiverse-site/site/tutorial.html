<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
Traditional concurrency control is considered to be one of the most complex subjects for developers. This is because
it is very hard to realize about improper synchronized programs because you need to deal with an extra dimension
of problems. So it isn't uncommon that concurrent code contains race problems or deadlocks. Take a look
at the following example:
<pre>
    public class Account{
        private int balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }

        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public void inc(int amount){
            if(balance + amount < 0)
                throw new NotEnooughMoneyException();
            }

            this.balance +=amount;
        }
    }
</pre>
If this Account object is concurrently accessed, strange problems could start to happen:
<ol>
    <li>It could be that money is lost or created; when 2 threads concurrently call the
    <li>
        It could be that the Account gets a negative balance;
    </li>
</ol>
Both are violations of the constraints of the system and could lead to serious problems. In databases these problems
normally would be solved by configuring the correct isolation level, or adding some pessimistic or optimistic
locking.
<p/>
The traditional approach to solving these problems is to springle the code with synchronized keywords and hope
that the problem is fixed, e.g.:

<pre>
    public class Account{
        private int balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }

        public synchronized int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public synchronized void inc(int amount){
            if(balance + amount < 0)
                throw new NotEnooughMoneyException();
            }

            this.balance +=amount;
        }
    }
</pre>


<h2 id="multiverse">Multiverse</h2>

With transactional memory, concurrency control is managed for you just like garbage collection for you. There are multiple
forms of transactional memory:
<ol>
    <li><b>software based:</b> where the transactional memory is created by adding the the logic in the software.
    </li>
    <li><b>hardware based:</b> where the transactional memory logic is added to the hardware (in the cpu for example).
        At the moment there is no support for hardware based transactional memory on most main stream processors,
        only the Sun Niagara III has support for it.
    </li>
    <li><b>hybrids:</b> where software and hardware based transactional memory completes each other. So the software
        part can take care of all the 'cool' extensions and the hardware part can help to get amazing performance.
    </li>
</ol>
Multiverse is a transactional memory implementation that is software based, but if hardware instructions are
added to the main stream cpu's <b>and</b> exposed by the JVM (just like CAS instructions like the AtomicLong),
Multiverse also wants to make use of those features.
<p/>
Multiverse relies on bytecode instrumentation to add the needed logic transactional objects (if you want you can also
bypass instrumentation but makes integration with the Java language more intrusive). To make an object
transaction, the TransactionalObject annotation needs to be added:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }

        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public void setBalance(int newBalance){
            if(newBalance == null){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
            this.balance = newBalance;
        }
    }
</pre>
This is all that is needed to make the Account object transactional. All

<h2 id="composability">Composability</h2>
With the traditional lock based approach it is hard to compose a new operation by executing multiple other operations,
e.g:

<pre>
@TransactionalMethod
public static void transfer(Account from Account to, int amount){
    from.setBalance(from.getBalance()-amount);
    to.setBalance(to.getBalance()+amount);
}
</pre>


<h2 id="transaction.mapping">Transaction Mapping</h2>

<h2 id="blocking.transactions">Blocking transactions</h2>
Apart from making objects transactional, there is a lot more than just correct isolation between thread; notification.
For example when a thread needs to wait on a BlockingQueue for an item to come available. With a lock
based approach you can make use lower primitives like:
<ol>
    <li><b>waitset:</b> that is part of every Object</li>
    <li><b>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition:</b>< that was introduced in Java 5/li>
</ol>
Or make use of higher blocking structures like the CountDownLatch. If I want to add a new function to the
SynchronizedAccount where a thread can block on the account to reach a balance, it would look something like this:

<pre>
    public class SynchronizedAccount{

        private volatile int balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }

        public synchronized int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public synchronized void setBalance(int newBalance){
            if(newBalance == null){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
            this.balance = newBalance;
            notifyAll();
        }

        public synchronized void await(int desiredBalance)throws InterruptibleException{
            while(desiredBalance != balance){
                wait();
            }
        }
    }
</pre>


if you look careful you can see that a loop is used in the await method. This is needed to deal with spurious wakeups
(so an accidental wakeup). If you forget about this, this await method could complete even though

The same behavior can also be realized with Multiverse:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.retry;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class TransactionalAccount{
        private int balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.balance = balance;
        }

        @TransactionalMethod(readonly = true)
        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public void setBalance(int newBalance){
            if(newBalance == null){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
            this.balance = newBalance;
        }

        public void await(int desiredBalance){
            if(desiredBalance != balance){
                retry();
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

The cool thing about the blocking behavior is that it also is possible to listen to multiple transactional objects. If
a transaction wants to listen on
