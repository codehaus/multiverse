<h2 id="question.1">Does Multiverse rely on instrumentation</h2>
No; although instrumentation is useful for seamless integration in the Java language, the STM itself can
perfectly be used without instrumentation. Since Multiverse 0.5 it is possible to a Javaagent (dynamic
instrumentation) or compiletime instrumentation.

<h2 id="question.2">Can Multiverse be used with different languages?</h2>
Multiverse can be used with different Java based languages like Groovy or Scala. For more information see the
<a href="otherjvmlanguages.html">Other JVM languages</a> page.

<h2 id="question.3">Can I use arbitrary threads?</h2>
Yes you can. Multiverse doesn't require any special threads or any special settings on threads.

<h2 id="question.4">Can multiple STM instances be used within the same JVM?</h2>
It depends. If you are not using the instrumentation, and not share any transactional objects between STM instances,
then you can use multiple STM instances. But once the instrumentation is used, the system always makes use of the
GlobalStmInstance. In the future this limitation may be removed, but there must be some mechanism for the transacional
methods to get their hands on a STM instance (perhaps a threadlocal that contains the stm instance to use).

<h2 id="question.5">Do I need a special JVM?</h2>
No you don't. You can use an ordinary Java 1.6+ JVM like the JVM from Sun or IBM.

<h2 id="question.6">Can the changes be persisted?</h2>
No, for the moment this isn't possible. But hooking some kind of persistance mechanism up to the stm shouldn't be
impossible and is planned for the future.

<h2 id="question.7">Can TransactionalObjects be combined with JPA/Hibernate annotations?</h2>
Probably not. Although no tests have been executed to make sure it doesn't work, the instrumentation process modifies
the class structure (and introduces new classes) of transactional objects. This probably is not going to be
a good match.

<h2 id="question.8">Can Multiverse be distributed</h2>
No, for the moment Multiverse doesn't support any functionality for creating a distributed STM. Although in theory
it would be possible (for example by using a transparant clustering technology like Terracotta), it would not
be very scalable. The main STM implementation, called the AlphaSTM, relies on a logical clock. When this clock
is distributed, the performance of the system is limited to the rate the clock can be increased over the network.
If a single increase takes 1ms, the maximum performance of the STM would be 1000 transactions/second no matter
how many machines you add (it probably is going to degrade because the time it to increase the clock is going
to increase). In the future we want to experiment with different approaches, but it doesn't have the highest
priority atm.

<h2 id="question.9">Which License is used</h2>
Multiverse is released under the <a href="license.html">Apache 2 License</a>.

<h2 id="question.10">Does Multiverse support blocking transactions?</h2>
Yes. For more information about blocking operations, check the <a href="manual-blocking.html">5 Minute guide to
    blocking transactions</a>.

<h2 id="question.11">Does Multiverse scale linearly?</h2>
No. Transactions that doesn't share state, should scale linearly (throw in twice as much hardware, and you will
get twice the performance). But there is 1 central component touched by every transaction: the clock.
This clock (an AtomicLong) will eventually cause a bottleneck. This issue is going to get a lot of attention.

<h2 id="question.12">Does Multiverse prevent deadlocking?</h2>
Yes. As long as transactional resources of Multiverse are used, transactions won't deadlock. There are 2 requirements
for a deadlock:
<ol>
    <li>uncontrolled order of locking</li>
    <li>uncontrolled waiting</li>
</ol>
Acquiring locks in Multiverse is done with a maximum waiting time, so the second condition for a deadlock is
not present. The lock behavior can be customized by providing a custom CommitLockPolicy implementation.

<h2 id="question.13">Does Multiverse prevent livelocking?</h2>
Multiverse is very optimistic, so it could be that while reading/writing to transactional object a failure is encountered
or when the transaction commits. The transaction management automatically retries the transaction in the hope that it
will succeed next time. Oncontrolled retrying could lead to livelocking because resources are consumed (memory
and cpu cycles) but no progress is made because transactions keep aborting. But retrying in Multiverse is bounded.
And can be configured with the maxRetries property of the TransactionalMethod annotation.

<h2 id="question.14">Does Multiverse prevent starvation?</h2>
No. Multiverse doesn't provide any guarantee that transaction that content over resources are going to commit. Meaning
that a transaction eventually fails with a TooManyRetriesException. A practical example of starving transactions
are long running transactions, the keep conflicting on very short running transactions. In the future a
contention manager is going to be added, but for the time being there is no support available.

<h2 id="question.15">Does Multiverse suffer from Zombie threads?</h2>
No. A transaction will always get transaction level read consistency. So it is impossible that a transaction sees
state that it shouldn't and could enter some infinite loop and becomes a zombie.

<h2 id="question.16">Can non transactional objects be used in transactions?</h2>
Yes you can. Normal objects can be used on transactions, for example a normal Person POJO (without the
TransactionalObject annotation) be exchanged over a transactional BlockingQueue (the TransactionalLinkedList)
for example. But changes made on these objects won't be protected by the transaction, so you need to
know what you are doing.

<h2 id="question.17">Can IO be used in transactions?</h2>
It is possible to do IO  in a transaction, but it could be that the transaction is aborted and restarted many times
(for example because a read conflict or write conflict is encountered). It is possible to register tasks to be executed
when a Transaction aborts or commits, giving the option to 'undo' what is done. Support for transacional IO is planned,
but doesn't have a high priority at the moment.

<h2 id="question.18">Does Multiverse provide support for pessimistic locking?</h2>
Not yet. In a transaction it isn't possible to 'claim' resources.  In the MVCC database Oracle (and MySQL + InnoDB and
Postgresql) it is possible to do a pessimistic lock using 'select .. for update'. In the near future such a mechanism
will be provided, but for the time being this
functionality is not available.

<h2 id="question.19">Does Multiverse provide support for nesting transactions?</h2>
Yes. Transactions can be nested and atm they will always be flattened (so only the other transaction counts). An abort
or commit will always be executed on the while transaction and not subtransactions. In the future different
progagation levels will be added (for example open nesting).

<h2 id="question.20">Does Multiverse allow non transaction access?</h2>
No this is not possible. The mutable state of a transactional object is moved to a tranlocal; object that contains
the transaction local state of a transactional object. To access the tranlocal, you always need a transaction.
When a transactional method is called without a transaction, a transaction automatically is started and
committed/aborted when the method completes.

<h2 id="question.21">Does Multiverse support early or late conflict detection?</h2>
It depends.

<h2 id="question.22">Does Multiverse support direct or deferred updates?</h2>
Multiverse only supports updates, so the changes are made when the transaction commits and not when the change (the
write on a transactional object) is made.

<h2 id="question.23">Can Multiverse be combined with traditional lock based technology?</h2>
Yes, it can. But this is not without risc; changes made in non transactional resources are not protected by the STM.
And blocking operations on non transactional resouces, doesnt benefit from deadlock detection, listening
to multiple blocking resources, etc. So if you know what you are doing, traditional lock based technology can
be combined with Multiverse.

<h2 id="question.24">Does Multiverse support privatization?</h2>
No. Privatization is a technique that can be used to temporary remove a transactional object from the STM so a transaction
has exclusive access.

<h2 id="question.25">Does Multiverse need special factories for creating transactional objects?</h2>
No. Transactional Object can be created with ordinary constructors.

<h2 id="question.26">Are Multiverse Transactions thread-safe?</h2>
No, a transaction is not thread-safe to use and therefor can't be used by multiple threads
concurrently. It is possible however to hand over a transaction from one thread to another
because the transation itself doesn't rely on any thread/threadlocal information. But it could
be that the systems in front of the STM (e.g. the instrumentation) does rely on this. So threads
can safely be handed over from one thread to another, if you really know what you are doing.
<p>
    The org.multiverse.api.Transaction can be compared to the Hibernate Session, that also isn't threadsafe to use.

<h2 id="question.27">Is lock based concurrency control bad?</h2>
I certainly don't think that lock based concurrency control is bad. Multiverse even couldn't exist with low
level synchronization structures like locks or cas instructions (AtomicLongs for example). But I do think that
lock based concurrency control is very complex; it is very easy to get in all sorts of traditional problems (race problems,
deadlocks etc) even for the more experienced developer. And next these well known issues, it also is quite
easy to introduce reordening or visibility problems if you don't understand the Java Memory Model well.
<p>
    That is why I think that STM's are a very valuable tool in the toolbox of developers, that could boost
    productivity if used correctly. You could compare it with Hibernate and raw SQL; Hibernate makes live easy
    because you don't need to deal with all the SQL issues all the time. But from time to time, you need to get
    dirty and use SQL directly to get the things done.

<h2 id="question.28">Multiverse and the Java Memory Model</h2>
The Java Memory Model is defined in happens before rules, for example the volatile variable rule that states
that all changes made before a volatile write, will be visible when a volatile read is done. Using this mechanism
it is possible to hand over an object graph from one thread to another without worrying about visibility
or reordering issues. Multiverse also provides a happens before rule: all changes made before a transaction commits,
will be visible to all starting transactions. So you don't need to worry about reordering or visibility problems.
<p>
    On a lower level this behavior is realized using CAS instructions (for example an AtomicReference) that provides
    the same happens before semantics as volatile variables.

<h2 id="question.29">Does Multiverse have object or field granularity?</h2>
It depends. The main STM implementation; the AlphaStm doesn't impose any restrictions on this behavior. It manages
'tranlocals' (transaction local state). And it doesn't matter if this is a single field (so field granularity)
or a complete object (object granularity). The advantage of object granularity is that there is less overhead.
The advantage of field granularity is that there will be less read or write conflicts. If the TransactionalObject
annotation is used, automatically object granularity is used. But if the org.multiverse.transactions.refs are
used, you have field granularity.

<h2 id="question.30">Does Multiverse have provides support for contention management?</h2>
No. Currently Multiverse doesn't provide any support for contention management. Contention management if very
usefull to provide certain fairness guarantees and to prevent livelocking and will be added in the future.
The big problem I currently see is that it could cause a lot of overhead and adding it all over could
impact performance all over. I believe that you only should pay for something when you are using it.

<h2 id="question.31">Do I need some fetch strategy for fields?</h2>
No, this isn't needed. Transactional objects that are fields of other transactional objects,
are loaded just in time (so just before a read or write happens). With databases this would lead to a lot
of small queries instead of catching them in 1 big batch and that is one of the reasons why you want
to influence the fetching behavior. But with Multiverse everything is in memory, so it doesn't matter if a
lot of small actions are done.

<h2 id="question.32">Can Multiverse be combined with Spring/Guice/...?</h2>
Yes it can. But atm there is no spring TransactionManager, so you have to make use of the instrumentation
or you have to make use of a more explicit approach (TransactionlReference/TransactionTemplate).

<h2 id="question.33">What is wrong with read or write conflicts?</h2>
During the execution of transactions it could be that a transaction is aborted because a read or write conflict
happened. Read and write conflicts are the way for software transactional memory to prevent unwanted interleavings
of transactions, and since no partial changes will be written (transactions are atomic), it doesn't cause
problems in transactional resources. But if there are a lot of conflicts, the processors will doing a lot of work and
consume memory (opening tranlocals, trying to commit, perhaps executing a lot of code in the transactional objects) without
making any progress. This is called a lifelock and something you want to prevent. If certain objects cause a lot
read/write locks then they cause contention and these structures will not scale. I think this is one of the main
areas of research for transactional memory to lower the amount of contention (for example transactional boosting).
<p>
    Atm Multiverse doesn't provide much support for this situation, except the
    <a href="manual-mapping.html#fieldgranularity">1.6 @FieldGranularity</a> annotation. But a lot of work will be
    done in this area.
    The most important low hanging fruit are the Multiverse collection implementations and the size field. For
    the time being these structures are not going to scale because they will conflict on this field, so it is important
    that for the time being to keep transactions on these structures short if there is contention.

<p>
    Multiverse provides basic support for preving transactions to livelock by limiting the maximum number of retries
    ( can be configured with the maxRetries) in combination with a backoff policy. Bby default an exponential backoff
    policy is used.

<h2 id="question.34">Does Multiverse touch java.util classes?</h2>
No, Multiverse doesn't instrument any classes in the java.util library. Only the classes you want to be instrumented,
are instrumented and if it doesn't contain anything interesting, it is ignored.

<h2 id="question.35">Does Multiverse work with the IBM JDK?</h2>
Yes. All unit and integration tests are executed using the IBM J9 1.6 JDK.  This is the exact version
used:
<pre>
    java version "1.6.0"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build pxa6460sr7-20091215_02(SR7))
    IBM J9 VM (build 2.4, JRE 1.6.0 IBM J9 2.4 Linux amd64-64 jvmxa6460sr7-20091214_49398 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)
</pre>
I don't have performance numbers (yet).

<h2 id="question.36">Does Multiverse work with the Open JDK?</h2>
Yes. All unit and integration tests are executed using Open JDK. This is the exact version used:
<pre>
    java version "1.7.0-ea"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-ea-b89)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 18.0-b02, mixed mode)
</pre>
I don't have performance numbers (yet).

<h2 id="question.37">I get a ClassCircularityError</h2>
If you get a ClassCicularityError while using the Multiverse Javaagent, changes
are big that you haven't configured the include property. If this isn't set explicitly
the javaagent will try to analyze all classes it encounters and this causes ASM to cause
problems. With the -Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.include
property on the command line. It expects a ';' seperated list of Classes to ignore. Example:
<pre>
    -Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.include=org.youproject.;org.anotherproject.
</pre>
Asterix can't be used (perhaps it will be added in the future). When the Multiverse Javaagent
starts, it lists the packages that are included/excluded so inspect that for more
information. If you also enable the verbose logging for the Javaagent using
-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.verbose=true, you can see better what is happing.
