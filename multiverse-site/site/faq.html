<h2 id="question.1">Does Multiverse rely on instrumentation</h2>
No; although instrumentation is useful for seamless integration in the Java language, the STM itself can
        perfectly be used without instrumentation. For the moment a Javaagent is needed if you want to use the
        org.multiverse.transactional package. In the future this limitation will be removed and some form
        of static instrumentation will be provided.

<h2 id="question.2">Can Multiverse be used with different languages?</h2>
Multiverse can be used with different Java based languages like Groovy or Scala. For more information see the
        <a href="otherjvmlanguages.html">Other JVM languages</a> page.

<h2 id="question.3">Can I use arbitrary threads?</h2>
Yes you can. Multiverse doesn't require any special threads.

<h2 id="question.4">Can multiple STM instances be used within the same JVM?</h2>
It depends. If you are not using the instrumentation, and not share any transactional objects between STM instances,
then you can use multiple STM instances. But once the instrumentation is used, the system always makes use of the
GlobalStmInstance. In the future this limitation may be removed, but there must be some mechanism for the transacional
methods to get their hands on a STM instance (perhaps a threadlocal that contains the stm instance to use).

<h2 id="question.5">Do I need a special JVM?</h2>
No you don't. You can use an ordinary Java 1.6+ JVM like the JVM from Sun or IBM.

<h2 id="question.6">Can the changes be persisted?</h2>
No, for the moment this isn't possible. But hooking some kind of persistance mechanism up to the stm shouldn't be
        impossible and is planned for the future.

<h2 id="question.7">Can TransactionalObjects be combined with JPA/Hibernate annotations?</h2>
Probably not. Although no tests have been executed to make sure it doesn't work, the instrumentation process modifies
        the class structure (and introduces new classes) of transactional objects. This probably is not going to be
        a good match.

<h2 id="question.8">Can Multiverse be distributed</h2>
No, for the moment Multiverse doesn't support any functionality for creating a distributed STM. Although in theory
        it would be possible (for example by using a transparant clustering technology like Terracotta), it would not
        be very scalable. The main STM implementation, called the AlphaSTM, relies on a logical clock. When this clock
        is distributed, the performance of the system is limited to the rate the clock can be increased over the network.
        If a single increase takes 1ms, the maximum performance of the STM would be 1000 transactions/second no matter
        how many machines you add (it probably is going to degrade because the time it to increase the clock is going
        to increase). In the future we want to experiment with different approaches, but it doesn't have the highest
        priority atm.

<h2 id="question.9">Which License is used</h2>
Multiverse is released under the <a href="license.html">MIT license</a>.

<h2 id="question.10">Does Multiverse support blocking transactions?</h2>
Yes. For more information about blocking operations, check the <a href="manual-blocking.html">5 Minute guide to
blocking transactions</a>.

<h2 id="question.11">Does Multiverse scale linearly?</h2>
No. Transactions that doesn't share state, should scale linearly (throw in twice as much hard ware, and you will
        get twice the performance). But there is 1 central component, touched by every transaction: the clock.
        This clock (an AtomicLong) will eventually cause a bottleneck. This issue is going to get a lot of attention.

<h2 id="question.12">Does Multiverse prevent deadlocking?</h2>
Yes. As long as transactional resources of Multiverse are used, transactions won't deadlock. There are 2 requirements
        for a deadlock:
<ol>
    <li>uncontrolled order of locking</li>
    <li>uncontrolled waiting</li>
</ol>
Acquiring locks in Multiverse is done with a maximum waiting time, so the second condition for a deadlock is
not present. The lock behavior can be customized by providing a custom CommitLockPolicy implementation.

<h2 id="question.13">Does Multiverse prevent livelocking?</h2>
Multiverse is very optimistic, so it could be that while reading/writing to transactional object a failure is encountered
or when the transaction commits. The transaction management automatically retries the transaction in the hope that it
        will succeed next time. Oncontrolled retrying could lead to livelocking because resources are consumed (memory
        and cpu cycles) but no progress is made because transactions keep aborting. But retrying in Multiverse is bounded.
        And can be configured with the maxRetryCount property of the TransactionalMethod annotation.

<h2 id="question.14">Does Multiverse prevent starvation?</h2>
No. Multiverse doesn't provide any guarantee that transaction that content over resources are going to commit. Meaning
        that a transaction eventually fails with a TooManyRetriesException. A practical example of starving transactions
        are long running transactions, the keep conflicting on very short running transactions. In the future a
        contention manager is going to be added, but for the time being there is no support available.

<h2 id="question.15">Does Multiverse suffer from Zombie threads?</h2>
No. A transaction will always get transaction level read consistency. So it is impossible that a transaction sees
        state that it shouldn't and could enter some infinite loop and becomes a zombie.

<h2 id="question.16">Can non transactional objects be used in transactions?</h2>
Yes you can. Normal objects can be used on transactions, for example a normal Person POJO (without the
        TransactionalObject annotation) be exchanged over a transactional BlockingQueue (the TransactionalLinkedList)
        for example. But changes made on these objects won't be protected by the transaction, so you need to
        know what you are doing.

<h2 id="question.17">Can IO be used in transactions?</h2>
It is possible to do IO  in a transaction, but it could be that the transaction is aborted and restarted many times
(for example because a read conflict or write conflict is encountered). It is possible to register tasks to be executed
when a Transaction aborts or commits, giving the option to 'undo' what is done.

<h2 id="question.18">Does Multiverse provide support for pessimistic locking?</h2>
Not yet. In a transaction it isn't possible to 'claim' resources.  In the MVCC database Oracle (and MySQL + InnoDB and
Postgresql) it is possible to do a pessimistic lock using 'select .. for update'. In the near future such a mechanism
will be provided, but for the time being this
        functionality is not available.

<h2 id="question.19">Does Multiverse provide support for nesting transactions?</h2>
Yes. Transactions can be nested and atm they will always be flattened (so only the other transaction counts). An abort
        or commit will always be executed on the while transaction and not subtransactions. In the future different
        progagation levels will be added (for example open nesting).

<h2 id="question.20">Does Multiverse allow non transaction access?</h2>
No this is not possible. The mutable state of a transactional object is moved to a tranlocal; object that contains
        the transaction local state of a transactional object. To access the tranlocal, you always need a transaction.
        When a transactional method is called without a transaction, a transaction automatically is started and
        committed/aborted when the method completes. 

<h2 id="question.21">Does Multiverse support early or late conflict detection?</h2>
It depends. 

<h2 id="question.22">Does Multiverse support direct or deferred updates?</h2>
Multiverse only supports updates, so the changes are made when the transaction commits and not when the change (the
        write on a transactional object) is made.

<h2 id="question.23">Can Multiverse be combined with traditional lock based technology?</h2>
Yes, it can. But this is not without risc; changes made in non transactional resources are not protected by the STM.
        And blocking operations on non transactional resouces, doesnt benefit from deadlock detection, listening
        to multiple blocking resources, etc. So if you know what you are doing, traditional lock based technology can
        be combined with Multiverse.

<h2 id="question.24">Does Multiverse support privatization?</h2>
No. Privatization is a technique that can be used to temporary remove a transactional object from the STM so a transaction
        has exclusive access.

<h2 id="question.25">Does Multiverse need special factories for creating transactional objects?</h2>
No. Transactional Object can be created with ordinary constructors.

<h2 id="question.26">Are Multiverse Transactions thread-safe?</h2>
No, a transaction is not thread-safe to use and therefor can't be used by multiple threads
        concurrently. It is possible however to hand over a transaction from one thread to another
        because the transation itself doesn't rely on any thread/threadlocal information. But it could
        be that the systems in front of the STM (e.g. the instrumentation) does rely on this. So threads
        can safely be handed over from one thread to another, if you really know what you are doing.
<p/>
The org.multiverse.api.Transaction can be compared to the Hibernate Session, that also isn't threadsafe to use.        

<h2 id="question.27">Is lock based concurrency control bad?</h2>
I certainly don't think that lock based concurrency control is bad. Multiverse even couldn't exist with low
        level synchronization structures like locks are cas (AtomicLongs for example). But I do think that lock based
        concurrency control is very complex; it is very easy to get in all sorts of traditional problems (race problems,
        deadlocks etc) even for the more experienced developer. And next these well known issues, it also is quite
        easy to introduce reordening or visibility problems if you don't understand the Java Memory Model well.
<p/>
        That is why I think that STM's are a very valuable tool in the toolbox of developers, that could boost
        productivity if used correctly. You could compare it with Hibernate and raw SQL; Hibernate makes live easy
        because you don't need to deal with all the SQL issues all the time. But from time to time, you need to get
        dirty and use SQL directly to get the things done.

<h2 id="question.28">Multiverse and the Java Memory Model</h2>
        The Java Memory Model is defined in happens before rules, for example the volatile variable rule that states
        that all changes made before a volatile write, will be visible when a volatile read is done. Using this mechanism
        it is possible to hand over an object graph from one thread to another without worrying about visibility
        or reordering issues. Multiverse also provides a happens before rule: all changes made before a transaction commits,
        will be visible to all starting transactions. So you don't need to worry about reordering or visibility problems. 
<p/>
        On a lower level this behavior is realized using CAS instructions (for example an AtomicReference) that provides
        the same happens before semantics as volatile variables.

<h2 id="question.29">Does Multiverse have object or field granularity?</h2>
It depends. The main STM implementation; the AlphaStm doesn't impose any restrictions on this behavior. It manages
        'tranlocals' (transaction local state). And it doesn't matter if this is a single field (so field granularity)
        or a complete object (object granularity). The advantage of object granularity is that there is less overhead.
        The advantage of field granularity is that there will be less read or write conflicts. If the TransactionalObject
        annotation is used, automatically object granularity is used. But if the org.multiverse.transactions.refs are
        used, you have field granularity.

<h2 id="question.30">Does Multiverse have provides support for contention management?</h2>
        No. Currently Multiverse doesn't provide any support for contention management. Contention management if very
        usefull to provide certain fairness guarantees and to prevent livelocking and will be added in the future.
        The big problem I currently see is that it could cause a lot of overhead and adding it all over could
        impact performance all over. I believe that you only should pay for something when you are using it.

<h2 id="question.31">Do I need some fetch strategy for fields?</h2>
        No, this isn't needed. Transactional objects that are fields of other transactional objects,
        are loaded just in time (so just before a read or write happens). With databases this would lead to a lot
        of small queries instead of catching them in 1 big batch and that is one of the reasons why you want
        to influence the fetching behavior. But with Multiverse everything is in memory, so it doesn't matter if a
        lot of small actions are done.

<h2 id="question.32">Can Multiverse be combined with Spring/Guice/...?</h2>
        Yes it can. But atm there is no spring TransactionManager, so you have to make use of the instrumentation
        or you have to make use of a more explicit approach (TransactionlReference/TransactionTemplate).
