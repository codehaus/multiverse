<h2 id="introduction">3.1 Introduction</h2>
It is possible in Multiverse to execute additional logic before or after a transaction aborts or commits. The following
lifecycle events are available:
<ol>
    <li><b>pre commit:</b> just before committing.
    </li>
    <li><b>post commit:</b> just after committing.
    </li>
    <li><b>pre abort:</b> just before aborting, so while the transaction still is active.
    </li>
    <li><b>post abort:</b> just after aborting.
    </li>
</ol>
There are all kinds of reasons why a transaction can abort, for example when there is a read or write conflict.
<p/>
At the moment there is no support for the pre en post start events because transactions always begin started. It could
be the unstarted state is added if it is needed.

<h2 id="transactionlifecyclelistener">3.2 TransactionLifecycleListener</h2>
<p/>
Using a org.multiverse.api.TransactionLifecycleListener you can listen to events, an example:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.api.*;

    public class PostCommitEventListener implements TransactionLifecycleListener{
        public  void notify(Transaction tx, TransactionLifecycleEvent event){
            if(event == TransactionLifecycleEvent.postCommit){
                System.out.println("Transaction is committed");
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

And this can be registered using the Transaction.register method that gives the following guarantees:
<ol>
    <li>It is guaranteed that the listeners are executed in the order they are registered</li>
    <li>It is guaranteed that the listeners are executed on the same thread that does the commit or abort</li>
</ol>

An example of using the Transaction.register method:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.api.Transaction;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import static org.multiverse.api.ThreadLocalTransaction.getThreadLocalTransaction;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        private int balance;

        public Account(){
            balance = 0;
        }

        public void transfer(int amount){
            balance+=amount;

            Transaction tx = getThreadLocalTransaction();
            tx.register(new PostCommitEventListener());
        }
    }
</pre>
In this example the 'Transaction is committed' is printed when the transfer method commits.

<h2 id="deferred.tasks">3.3 Deferred tasks</h2>
A deferred tasks is a task that is executed after the transaction commits and are very useful to execute actions
on non transactional resources. If these resources are used inside the transaction, it could be that they
are called more than once because a transaction can be restarted. A good example is starting threads
after a Transaction commits. A deferred task can be created using the TransactionLifecycleListener.

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.api.*;

    public class PostCommitEventListener implements TransactionLifecycleListener{
        public  void notify(Transaction tx, TransactionLifecycleEvent event){
            if(event == TransactionLifecycleEvent.postCommit){
                System.out.println("Executing deferred task");
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
It is important to realize that when the notify method accesses transactional objects, this is done in a new
transaction.
<p>
    Luckily there also is a shortcut for creating and scheduling a deferred task:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.scheduleDeferredTask;

    @TransactionalMethod
    public void foo(){
        scheduleDeferredTask(new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                System.out.println("Executing deferred task");
            }
        });
    }
</pre>
Under water the runnable automatically is wrapped in a TransactionLifecycleListener and registered on the Transaction
in the TransactionThreadLocal. If no transaction is found, a NoTransactionFoundException is thrown. It consumes
a little more space since an additional object needs to be created (next to the TransactionLifecycleListener).


<h2 id="compensating.tasks">3.4 Compensating tasks</h2>
A compensating tasks is a tasks that is executed after a transaction aborts. They are very useful to implement
cleanup actions like removing resources (files for example) that have been created. A compensating tasks
can be created using
the TransactionLifecycleListener:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.api.*;

    public class PostCommitEventListener implements TransactionLifecycleListener{
        public  void notify(Transaction tx, TransactionLifecycleEvent event){
            if(event == TransactionLifecycleEvent.postAbort){
                System.out.println("Executing compensating task");
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
It is important to realize that when the notify method accesses transactional objects, it is done in a new
transaction.

<p>
    Luckily there also is a shortcut for creating and scheduling a compensating task:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.scheduleCompensatingTask;

    @TransactionalMethod
    public void foo(){
        scheduleCompensatingTask(new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                System.out.println("Executing compensating task");
            }
        });
    }
</pre>

in the TransactionThreadLocal. If no transaction is found, a NoTransactionFoundException is thrown. It consumes
a little more space since an additional object needs to be created (next to the TransactionLifecycleListener).


<h2 id="transactionlifecyclelistener.and.transactions">3.5 TransactionLifecycleListener and exceptions</h2>
If an exception is thrown while
the TransactionLifecycleListener.notify method is called, other follwing TransactionLifecycleListeners
for the same TransactionLifecycleEvent are not executed. This is a schema that shows what happens when
an exception is thrown during during a TransactionLifecycleEvent:
<ol>
    <li><b>pre commit:</b> the transaction is aborted and pre/post abort tasks are executed.</li>
    <li><b>post commit:</b> the transaction stays committed.</li>
    <li><b>pre abort:</b> the transaction is aborted and the post abort tasks are called.</li>
    <li><b>post abort:</b> the transaction stays aborted.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="executing.listeners.asynchronously.parallel">3.6 Executing TransactionLifecycleListeners
    parallel/asynchronously</h2>
TransactionLifecycleListeners are executed on the thread that aborts or commits. But in some cases you these tasks
to be executed in paralellel or asynchronously. This behavior it not integrated in the Multiverse Api's,
but can be realized by using an java.util.concurrent.Executor:

<pre>
    import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

    import org.multiverse.api.Transaction;
    import org.multiverse.api.TransactionLifecycleEvent;
    import org.multiverse.api.TransactionLifecycleListener;

    class LongTaskEventListener implements TransactionLifecycleListener{

        private final Executor executor = ...

        @Override
        public  void notify(Transaction tx, TransactionLifecycleEvent event){
            if(event == TransactionLifecycleEvent.postCommit){
                LongTask longTask = new SomeLongTask();
                executor.execute(longTask);
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
Warning: an executor normally has not an unbound workqueue, and it also can shut down. So it could be that the
executor starts throwing a RejectedExecutionException when the execute method is called, it could prevent
the execution of the other listeners. This is the default behavior for dealing with exceptions on
TransactionLifecycleListeners. To bypass this behavior, and to make sure that the listeners do get called,
make sure to add a RejectedExecutionException handler.

<pre>
    import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
    import java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException;

    import org.multiverse.api.Transaction;
    import org.multiverse.api.TransactionLifecycleEvent;
    import org.multiverse.api.TransactionLifecycleListener;

    class LongTaskEventListener implements TransactionLifecycleListener{

        private final Executor executor = ...

        @Override
        public  void notify(Transaction tx, TransactionLifecycleEvent event){
            if(event == TransactionLifecycleEvent.postCommit){
                LongTask longTask = new SomeLongTask();
                try{
                    executor.execute(longTask);
                }catch(RejectedExecutionException ex){
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
