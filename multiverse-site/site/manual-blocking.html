<h2 id="introduction">2.1 Introduction</h2>
This chapter desctibes how blocking transactions can be created. Blocking transactions are very useful to wait
on a state change to happen if the current state doesnt suite your needs, for example a waiting on
a item on a BlockingQueue to appear. If you need a short refresh
of your memory, check the <a href="#lockbased.approach">Lock based approach</a> or else jump to the
<a href="#blocking.transactions">Blocking transactions</a>.

<h2 id="lockbased.approach">2.2 Lock based approach</h2>
Using traditional lock based concurrency control, blocking operations can be created by using low level
blocking primitives like the java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition or the waitset (every Java Object
has a waitset that is integrated with the intrinsic lock). But also higher blocking abstraction
like the Semaphore or CountDownLatches are available.

<p/>
If you want to create a blocking Stack using the waitset in combination with the intrinsic lock, you
would get something like this:
<pre>
    public class Stack{

        private volatile Node head;

        public Stack(){
            head = null;
        }

        public boolean isEmpty(){
            return head == null;
        }

        public E pop()throws InterruptedException{
            synchronized(this){
                while(head == null){
                    await();
                }

                Node oldHead = head;
                head = oldHead.next;
                return oldHead.value;
            }
        }

        public void push(Object item){
            if(item == null){
                throw new NullPointerException();
            }

            synchronized(this){
                head = new Node(item,head);
                notify();
            }
        }

        final static class Node{
            private final Object value;
            private final Node next;

            public Node(Object value, Node next){
                this.value = value;
                this.next = next;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

Check that you need to deal with the loop for checking the head == null condition in the pop() method. This is required
because in Java it is allowed to receive spurious wakeups using waitsets. Check that you also need to make
head volatile for the isEmpty() check, this is needed because without the volatile (or without acquiring and
releasing intrinsic lock of 'this'), there could be a Java Memory Model violation.
<p/>

And using the java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock & Condition, it would look like this:

<pre>

import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

public class Stack{

        private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        private Condition itemAvailableCondition = lock.newCondition();
        private volatile Node head;

        public Stack(){
            head = null;
        }

        public boolean isEmpty(){
            return head == null;
        }

        public E pop()throws InterruptedException{
            lock.lock();
            try{
                while(head == null){
                    itemAvalableCondition.await();
                }
                Node oldHead = head;
                head = oldHead.next;
                return oldHead.value;
            }finally{
                lock.release();
            }
        }

        public void push(Object item){
            if(item == null){
                throw new NullPointerException();
            }

            lock.lock();
            try{
                head = new Node(item,head);
                itemAvailableCondition.signal();
            }finally{
                lock.release();
            }
        }

        final static class Node{
            private final Object value;
            private final Node next;

            public Node(Object value, Node next){
                this.value = value;
                this.next = next;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
In most cases a lot of blocking components luckily can be picked of the shelf, because they are very hard to get right.
Fortunately Java already has an excelent concurrency library that was introduced in Java 5 with JSR-166.

<h2 id="blocking.transactions">2.3 Blocking transactions</h2>
With Multiverse blocking transactions are less complicated than with the <a href="#lockbased.approach">lock based
    approach</a>
because there is no need to deal with locks or spurious wakeups explicitly. because
<b>automatically</b> all instance methods of transactional objects are able to participate in blocking
operations (unless the instance method is made readonly).

<h2 id="the.retry.primitive">2.4 The retry primitive</h2>
The retry primitive is

Underneath you can see a TransactionalStack POJO with TransactionalObject annotation. Each instance
method automatically is executed an update transaction and can be used in blocking operations
(it does automatic read tracking).
<pre>

    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.retry;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class TransactionalStack{

        private Node head;

        public Stack(){
            head = null;
        }

        @TransactionalMethod(readonly = true)
        public boolean isEmpty(){
            return head == null;
        }

        public E pop(){
            if(isEmpty()){
                retry();
            }

            Node oldHead = head;
            head = oldHead.next;
            return oldHead.value;
        }

        public void push(Object item){
            if(item == null){
                throw new NullPointerException();
            }
            head = new Node(item,head);
        }

        final static class Node{
            private final Object value;
            private final Node next;

            public Node(Object value, Node next){
                this.value = value;
                this.next = next;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
If you take a closer look at the pop method, you'll see that StmUtils.retry() method is called when
there is no item on the stack. When this method is called, the STM knows that the transaction can't make
progress and blocks it until a write on the field 'head' is done by a different transaction.
When this happens, the blocked transaction is notified by the STM and continues execution.

<h2 id="multiple.blocking.resources">2.5 Multiple blocking resources</h2>
With traditional blocking concurrency control, it is hard to wait on multiple blocking resources. For example
if you want to pop an item from one of 2 stacks, you have a serious problem because each stack will have
its own waitset/Condition and it is not possible to sleep on both.
<p/>
With STM this behavior is very easy to realize. We have already seen that a popping
transaction that was blocked after calling the retry() method, automatically is notified when a write on the head is done.
But by default in an update transaction, listening is done automatically on all transactional object that have reveived
reads or writes inside that transaction.
<p/>

Take a look at the following approach for this problem:
<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.*;

    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.retry;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class TransactionalFunkyStack{

        private final TransactionalStack stack1 = new TransactionalStack();
        private final TransactionalStack stack2 = new TransactionalStack();

        public void push1(Object item){
            stack1.push(item);
        }

        public void push2(Object item){
            stack2.push();
        }

        public Object pop(){
            if(!stack1.isEmpty()){
                return stack1.pop();
            }

            if(!stack2.isEmpty()){
                return stack2.pop();
            }

            retry();
            return null;
        }
    }
</pre>
Because the pop method calls the isEmpty() method of stack1 and stack2 when neither of them contain an item, both stacks
are read and automatically tracked by the transaction of the pop() method of the TransactionalFunkyStack. When
the retry() is executed on the end, it blocks the thread and the STM notifies the thread when an updates has
executed on stack1 or stack2. Unfortunately the retry is not a recognized language element like the throws clause,
so to make sure that the compiler doesn't complain about not returning anything, null is returned at the end.
But this code will never be executed.
<p/>
On a lower level a RetryError is thrown by the retry() method and ends the current execution of the transaction.
The transaction management logic (added by the instrumentation) of the pop method catches this RetryError
and creates a Latch (a blocking structure that can be used to let threads wait until some condition occurs)
and registers this latch to all read transactional objects that have been tracked by the transaction (this also
includes transactional objects that are modified).

<h2 id="noretrypossibleexception">2.6 NoRetryPossibleException</h2>
If a retry() is done without any transactional objects being used inside the transaction, there is no way
for the transaction to be notified because it isn't listening to any change. Essentially it means that the
transaction is going to deadlock because it can't wakup.
<p/>
Luckily Multiverse is able to detect this problem and throws a NoRetryPossibleException when there are no tracked
reads. In some cases some of the reads are tracked, but not all (for example a non read tracking update
transaction). If a retry is executed with these transactions, it also leads to a NoRetryPossibleException. This
is done to prevent listening to an arbitrary set of transactional objects and therefor create more predictable
behavior.

<h2 id="the.orelse.primitive">2.7 The orelse primitive</h2>
With an STM it is easy to listen to multiple resources using the retry primitive. But if you look at the pop() method in
<a href="#multiple.blocking.resources">Multiple blocking
    resources</a>, you can see that first all structures are checked,
and then a retry is done. But what if a retry is done in code you can't change, but you want to check out
other branches? That is where the 'orelse' primitive is for. It makes it possible to compose blocking
operations. The pop() method of the FunkyTransactionalStack could also have been written using the
orelse primitive:

<pre>
        import org.multiverse.templates.OrElseTemplate;

        @TransactionalObject
        public class TransactionalFunkyStack{

            ...

            public Object pop(){
                return new OrElseTemplate(){
                    public void run(){
                        return stack1.pop();
                    }
                    public void runorelse(){
                        return stack2.pop();
                    }
                }.execute();
            }
        }
</pre>
By using the OrElseTemplate it is possible compose the pop transaction on stack1 and the pop transaction of
stack2. Onfurtunately Java doesn't support Closures till Java 7, so we are stuck with this verbose
syntax.
<p/>
It also is possible to nest orelse blocks, e.g.:
<pre>
        import org.multiverse.templates.OrElseTemplate;
        import org.multiverse.annotations.*;

        @TransactionalObject
        public class TransactionalFunkyStack{

            ...

            public Object pop(){
                return new OrElseTemplate(){
                    public void run(){
                        return new OrElseTemplate(){
                            public void run(){
                                return stack1.pop();
                            }
                            public void runorelse(){
                                return stack2.pop();
                            }
                        }.execute();
                    }
                    public void runorelse(){
                        return new OrElseTemplate(){
                            public void run(){
                                return stack3.pop();
                            }
                            public void runorelse(){
                                return stack4.pop();
                            }
                        }.execute();
                    }
                }.execute();
            }
        }
</pre>

<h2 id="blocking.readonly.transaction">2.8 Blocking readonly transactions</h2>
By default, readonly transactions in Multiverse, are not able to be blocking because tracking reads, costs memory
and cpu cycles. In most cases, when you block, you also are going to do updates, so that is why automatic read
tracking is enabled by default on update transactions and is disabled by default on readonly transactions.
<p/>
But it is possible to create a blocking readonly transaction using the
automaticReadTracking property. The following fragment shows a new method on the TransactionalStack
where a wait can be done until the stack becomes empty.
<pre>
        import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;

        ...

        @TransactionalMethod(readonly = true, automaticReadTracking = true)
        public void awaitEmpty(){
            if(head == null){
                retry();
            }
        }
</pre>

<h2 id="interruptible.transactions">2.9 Interruptible transactions</h2>
With the intrinsic lock in Java it wasn't possible to interrupt a thread once it has entered the lock.
With the java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock this was finally solved when the JSR-166 library was added in
Java 5. The advantage of a thread being interruptible, is that it can be interrupted by another thread (in most cases
these are some form of management threads) and abort their operation.
<p/>
In Multiverse this behavior can be configured using the interruptible property in the TransactionalMethod annotation.
Default all transactions are non interruptible, but this behavior can be customized by setting the
interruptible property on the TransactionalMethod annotation, e.g.:

<pre>
    @TransactionalMethod(interruptible = true)
    public E popInterruptible()implements InterruptedException{
        if(head == null){
            retry();
        }

        Node oldHead = head;
        head = oldHead.next;
        return oldHead.value;
    }
</pre>
The popInterruptible will be interruptible when it blocks (so when the Stack is empty). So unlike traditional lock
based approaches, interruptibility is not configured on the blocking resources but on the transaction.
<p/>
It is important that the popInterruptible method does define an Exception or InterruptedException. If this is missing,
the Multiverse Javaagent will complain. It also is important to realize that it isn't sufficient to add
the InterruptedException without setting the interruptible property of the TransactionalMethod annotation.

<h2 id="blocking.transactional.references.and.primitives">2.10 Blocking transaction references and primitives</h2>
In the org.multiverse.transactional.references package, different TransactionReference and transactional
primitives are provided. All these implementations are able to participate in blocking transaction, so
they can be used to wait on some value to appear:
<pre>

    import org.multiverse.transactional.primitives.*;

    public class Person{
        private final TransactionalInteger age = new TransactionalInteger();

        public int getAge(){
            return age.get();
        }

        public void void setAge(int age){
            if(age&lt;0){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
            this.age = age;
        }

        public void awaitToBecome(int expectedAge){
            age.await(expectedAge);
        }
    }
</pre>
It is import to understand that Multiverse doesn't see any difference between with respect
to blocking behavior. This means that all blocking techniques that can be used on transactional objects,
can also be used on the transactional references and transactional primitives.


<h2 id="timeouts">2.11 Timeouts</h2>
At the moment it isn't possible to work with timeouts if a transaction blocks, this functionality
will be implemented in the near future. This topic contains information about the expected
look and feel of the implementation.
<p/>
Timeouts are very useful
to prevent waiting indeterminetly and will be added in the near future. From a technical point of view it
is quite simple te realize, there already exists a more sophisticated Latch called the StandardLatch
(based on java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition) that provides access to timed waiting. But the problem is more
on a conceptual level because transactions can be retried. I think it is best to create some kind of timeout
'savings-account' that is used to determine
how long a transaction can wait. Once a blocking transaction continues, it calculates to total time spend
waiting and substracts this from the savings-account.
<p/>
Eventually the following approaches are going to be added:
<pre>
    @TransactionalMethod(timeout = 10, unit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    void doit(){
        ...
    }

    @TransactionalMethod(timeoutSignatureScan=true)
    void doit(long timeout, TimeUnit unit){
        ...
    }
</pre>
The syntax is still subject to change.

<h2 id="fairness">2.12 Fairness</h2>
Atm the moment it isn't possible to provide any fairness guarantees on


<h2 id="blocking.inefficiencies">2.13 Blocking inefficiencies</h2>
Although the current blocking implementation works very good, it also is subject to some inefficiencies:
<ol>
    <li><b>listening to too many transactional objects:</b> atm a transaction will listen to all transactional
        objects that have been read by the transaction and therefor are tracked. This increases stress on the
        system because even object that are uninteresting from a blocking point of view. In the future more explicit
        mechanisms may be added to track only specific object instead of all objects. This will probably be based
        on the work of ... Harris.
    </li>
    <li><b>false wakeups: </b>although blocking transactions are not subject to spurious wakeups traditional
        blocking primitives suffer from, it could suffer from false wakeups. Concurrently there is no control on
        when a transaction needs to be notified; if there is any read on the transactional object it listens to,
        it will be notified. In the future some kind of predicate may be added to the latch that can be evaluated
        when another thread does a write.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="nonblocking.transactions">2.14 Non blocking transactions</h2>
At the moment this functionality is in progress and expected to be included in the Multiverse 0.4 release. The
big advantage of using an STM is that it is possible to use a different model than a thread per transaction, so
you could run thousands of transactions 'concurrently' while only using a few threads.

<h2 id="transactional.collection.framework">2.15 Transactional collections framework</h2>
Multiverse already provides a few blocking implementations of the Java Collections Framework. Currently the following
collections are provided:
<ol>
    <li><b>TransactionalLinkedList</b> that acts as Collection, List, Queue, Deque, BlockingQueue and BlockingDeque</li>
</ol>
These can be used as drop in replacements. We are working on more implementations
(the TransactionalTreeMap/TransactionalTreeSet, TransactionalHashMap/TransactionalSet and TransactionalArrayList)
are planned.
