<h2 id="command.line">Command-line</h2>
If you want to execute your application (using Multiverse) from the command-line, you need to add the
javaagent for Multiverse, e.g.:
<pre>
    java -javaagent:multiverse-alpha-0.4.jar ...
</pre>
This Javaagent (for the AlphaStm) contains all libraries needed for Multiverse. So no worries about other dependencies.
You don't need to the add 'multiverse-alpha-0.4.jar' classpath since it already will be made available
on the classpath through the javaagent mechanism.

<h2 id="ant">ANT</h2>
Not available since we are not using ANT. Check the documentation for the other environments to see what needs
to be done. And I would be very grateful if you can send me a short description so I can improve this documentation.

<h2 id="maven2">Maven 2</h2>
Check the following <a href="pom.xml">pom</a> for a complete working configuration. It is configured for the
0.4 Snapshot release. One of the things that has been added as is the javaagent configuration for the surefire plugin.

<h2 id="intellij">IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
Under IntelliJ IDEA, you need to set the Java agent this. This can be done by going to menu 'Run' -> 'Edit Configuration'.
This will popup a dialog and press the 'edit defaults' button at the bottom left of this dialog. This will open the
'Default Settings' dialog. Select 'Junit' and edit the 'VM Parameters' textfield. If you are using Maven 2
for your project, you can enter the following string:
<pre>
    -javaagent:/home/alarmnummer/.m2/repository/org/multiverse/multiverse-alpha/0.4/multiverse-alpha-0.4.jar
</pre>
Make sure that that you replace '/home/alarmnummer' by the location where your repository can be found and make sure
that the multiverse-alpha jar has been downloaded in your repository. If you are not
using Maven 2, you need to <a href="download.html">download</a> Mutiverse and extract is somewhere and use the following
text for the 'VM Parameters' textfield.
<pre>
    -javaagent:SOMEDIR/multiverse-alpha-0.4.jar
</pre>
Make sure that you replace 'SOMEDIR' by the absolute path to the directory that contains the multiverse-alpha-0.4.jar.
