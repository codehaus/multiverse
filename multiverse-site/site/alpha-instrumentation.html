<h1>Instrumentation for the Alpha STM</h1>
In Multiverse every STM is allowed to have it own instrumentation, because this provides a lot of flexibility.
The main STM implementation of Multiverse is the AlphaStm: it contains a lot of features and is stable.
This page describes which optimizations have been added.

<h2>Tranlocal</h2>
All managed fields of a transactional object are moved to a new structure called the Tranlocal (Transaction Local).
So what essentially happens is this:
<pre>
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;
    }
</pre>
This is transformed to:
<pre>
    class Person{
        PersonTranlocal current;
    }

    class PersonTranlocal{
        String name;
        int age;
    }
</pre>
When a read or write is done on a managed field of a transactional object, the transaction is asked to open
the transactional object for reading or writing. All tranlocals that are opened for write are attached to the
transaction, and if readtracking is enabled, the tranlocal that is opened for reading is attached to the
transaction as well. One of the main goals of the instrumentation is to prevent unwanted access to the transaction
for opening the tranlocal once it has been opened.

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<h2>Final fields</h2>
There is no overhead on accessing final (and other non managed fields like volatile or static). The more you make final,
the easier it will be on the STM because:
<ol>
    <li>less fields need to be copied</li>
    <li>less transaction access needs to be done</li>
    <li>less fields needs to be checked for dirtyness etc etc.</li>
</ol>
So if you get the chance, make it final (is a good practice anyway).

<h2>Transactional object without fields</h2>
If a transactional object doesn't have any managed fields (for example because they are all final), no tranlocal
needs to be created and therefor it causes no overhead.

<h3>Transaction access</h3>
Instead of going to the ThreadLocalTransaction to retrieve the current Transactions, a clone of the transactional
method is made (multiple clones to be correct) which has an extra argument: the transaction. So the instrumented
code can access the transaction by loading a local variable (so a simple ALOAD).

<h3>Getter/setter</h3>
Normally simple getters/setters are inlined by the JIT (so no overhead of a method call). In Multiverse
additional logic is added to methods, so the JIT has less chance to do its work. In the 0.5 release inlining
of transactional getters/setters (getters and setters of managed fields) is not automatically done.
It also makes future optimizations in Multiverse easier because there is a larger set of instructions
to optimize and this increases the chance of recognizing certain patterns.
<p>
    Getter/setter inlining only works for final methods (all methods of a final class are also final) and
    it works if the Java compiler is able to determine that a private getter/setter is called (so INVOKE_SPECIAL).
    A getter/setter is not determined based on the name, but by analyzing the instructions of the method.

<h3>Transactional management skip</h3>
For every transactional method, a whole bunch of new synthetic methods are added which are optimized for
readonly or update transactions. The original logic is removed from the transactional method and copied
to the synthetic versions (these also contain an extra argument: the Transaction). The transactionmanagement
logic relaces the original logic, so the original method does the transaction management:
<ol>
    <li>looks up the current transaction on the ThreadLocalTransaction</li>
    <li>if one is available it forwards to one of the synthetic methods</li>
    <li>if one is not available, it starts a transaction, forwards it to one of the synthetic methods,
        and commits/aborts/retries if needed.
    </li>
</ol>
But once you are inside a synthethic method that contains the original logic, the instrumented code will directly
call the synthetic version of a transactional method directly, completely bypassing any unneeded transaction
management logic.
<p>
    Transactional management skip is not possible if the instrumentation process is not able to
    determine if a call is a transactional method or not. In this case the 'original' method needs to
    be called and the useless transaction check needs to be done again.
<p>
    That is a performance reason why using a transactional interface/object instead of a normal interface/object
    (e.g. TransactionalList vs List) should be used if possible. If a normal interface/object is used, the
    instrumentation is not able to detect if a method is transactional, and is not able to apply this optimization.

<h3>New transactional data-structures</h3>
Instead of calling an Transaction.openForWrite(transactionalObject), the Transaction.openForConstruction is called.
The advantage is that the transaction can detect if there are only new and readonly transactional objects
attached to that transaction, and in case of only new objects, it can simplify the commit process:
<ol>
    <li>The writelock doesn't need to be acquired</li>
    <li>The central clock doesn't need to be increased</li>
</ol>
So from a scalability perspective creating new transactional datastructures should be just as expensive as
reading them.

<h3>This access</h3>

Before the optimization:
<pre>
    class IntRef{
        void inc(Transaction tx){
            ((IntRefTranlocal)tx.openForWrite(this)).value =
                ((IntRefTranlocal)tx.openForRead(this)).value+1;
        }
    }
</pre>

After the optimization:
<pre>
    class IntRef{
        void inc(Transaction tx, IntRefTranlocal tranlocal){
            if(tranlocal.isCommitted()){
                tranlocal = ((IntRefTranlocal)tx.openForWrite(this));
            }

            tranlocal.value=tranlocal.value+1;
        }
    }
</pre>
As you can see, reading the tranlocal has become a lot cheaper. And writing the tranlocal is very cheap once it
has been opened for write. And if an instance method of a transactional object, calls another instance method on the
        same object, the tranlocal can be send to that call as well. So once calls stay inside a single transactional
        object, the tranlocal doesn't need to be retrieved very often (if you are lucky it only needs to be
        retrieved once).

<h3>Local variable access</h3>
If a local variable is a transactional object, extra local variable will be generated containing the tranlocal. This
        also reduces the number of times a tranlocal needs to be retrieved.

        

<h3>Multiverse Javaagent vs Multiverse Compiler</h3>
All optimizations are enabled by default in the Multiverse Compiler.
