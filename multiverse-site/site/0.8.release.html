<h2>Multiverse 0.8</h2>

The features that are planned for the 0.8 release are not cast in stone atm, but the following is on the radar:
<ol>
    <li>Abort for: atm a transaction will always abort for any throwable, </li>
    <li>Spring support: to make Multiverse easy to integrate with Spring based applications</li>
    <li>JTA support:</li>
    <li>TransactionalList/TransactionalDeque</li>
    <li>Transactional Hashmap/HashSet</li>
    <li>Contention Management</li>
    <li>Lock acquire policy: atm a configurable amount of spinning is used, but for lock that are acquired for a longer period, spinning is very inefficient. So
    blocking locks needed and should be done through a lock acquire policy. This is needed to make it possible to use the STM as a more traditional locking
    solutions</li>
    <li>Read/write locks:</li>
    <li>Better alignment with <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/">Gigaspaces</a>. I use Gigaspaces at work in combination with traditional concurrency control,
    but I want to experiment with aligning Multiverse with more traditional lock based solutions like GigaSpaces so the traditional lock based concurrency control
    can be removed.</li>
    <li>Profiler</li>
    <li>Instrumentation for Java</li>
    <li>tryprivatize/tryensure</li>
</ol>

Improved performance:
<ol>
    <li>instead of doing 'expensive' arrive/depart operations on reads to provide read consistency, for very short transaction it probably is cheaper to do a full
    conflict scan instead of expensive cas operations for the arrive/depart</li>
    <li>
        less overhead on transactions. I already experimented with transaction implementations where the need for pooling tranlocals is removed since the transaction
        itself will act as the pool.
    </li>
    <li>
        removal of volatile writes:
    </li>
</ol>
