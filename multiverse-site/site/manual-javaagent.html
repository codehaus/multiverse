<h2 id="introduction">10.1 Introduction</h2>
Multiverse relies heavily on instrumentation to integrate seamlessly in Java. It can be done dynamic using the
Multiverse Javaagent or it can be done compiletime using the Multiverse Compiler. The advantage of runtime
instrumentation is that it is a lot easier to use in a development environment, because often it is very hard
to add some bytecode postprocessing step in the IDE.
<p>
    The Multiverse Javaagent is designed to be used from IDE's and can be used on oninstrumented, instrumented and
    any mix. So from your IDE you don't need to be worried if classes have received the correct transformation,
    as long as you have the Multiverse Javaagent installed. The Multiverse Javaagent and Multiverse Compiler share
    the same Instrumentor; Multiverse specific component responsible for instrumenting classes.
<p>
    The Multiverse Javaagent will detect if code already is instrumented by the Multiverse Compiler and
    there is a mismatch in the used Instrumentor or version of the Instrumentor. So you don't need to be worried
    about mixing them.

<h2 id="optimizations">10.2 Optimizations</h2>
The Multiverse Javaagent is not able to optimize as much as the Multiverse Compiler (caused by limitations
in the javaagent technology). So if you want to get the most out of performance, make sure that you
are using the Multiverse Compiler.
<p>
    You also need to watch out, when you are using a profiler, that
    preinstrumented classes are used. It is no problem to add the Multiverse Javaagent to a profiler (I
    use it in combination with JProfiler extensively), but since the performance of the instrumented code
    instrumented by the Multiverse Javaagent is suboptimal, it could be that you are hunting ghosts.
