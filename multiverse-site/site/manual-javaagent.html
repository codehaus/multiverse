<h2 id="introduction">10.1 Introduction</h2>
Multiverse relies heavily on instrumentation to integrate seamlessly in Java. It can be done dynamic using the
Multiverse Javaagent or it can be done compiletime using the Multiverse Compiler. The advantage of runtime
instrumentation is that it is a lot easier to use in a development environment, because often it is very hard
to add some bytecode postprocessing step in the IDE.
<p>
    The Multiverse Javaagent is designed to be used from IDE's and can be used on oninstrumented, instrumented and
    any mix. So from your IDE you don't need to be worried if classes have received the correct transformation,
    as long as you have the Multiverse Javaagent installed. The Multiverse Javaagent and Multiverse Compiler share
    the same Instrumentor; Multiverse specific component responsible for instrumenting classes.
<p>
    The Multiverse Javaagent will detect if code already is instrumented by the Multiverse Compiler and
    there is a mismatch in the used Instrumentor or version of the Instrumentor. So you don't need to be worried
    about mixing them.

<h2 id="optimizations">10.2 Optimizations</h2>
The Multiverse Javaagent is not able to optimize as much as the Multiverse Compiler (caused by limitations
in the javaagent technology). So if you want to get the most out of performance, make sure that you
are using the Multiverse Compiler.
<p>
    You also need to watch out, when you are using a profiler, that
    preinstrumented classes are used. It is no problem to add the Multiverse Javaagent to a profiler (I
    use it in combination with JProfiler extensively), but since the performance of the instrumented code
    instrumented by the Multiverse Javaagent is suboptimal, it could be that you are hunting ghosts.

<h2 id="commandlineinterface">10.3 Command Line Interface</h2>
The Multiverse javaagent needs to set up using the javaagent argument on the java command.
<pre>
    java -javaagent:/path/to/multiverse-alpha-0.6.jar ....
</pre>
The multiverse jar is completely self contained, so you don't need to worry about
dependent jars.

<p>
    The Multiverse Javaagent can be configured by setting System properties
    from the cli. A complete listing of the properties:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.verbose</td>
        <td>verbose output. Value is a boolean and defaults to false.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.dumpBytecode</td>
        <td>if the bytecode should be dumped for
            debugging purposes. Value is boolean and defaults to false.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.include</td>
        <td>semicolon separated list of packages to
            exclude. E.g. com.sun.;com.yourcompany.; If this is not specified, all packages will be included
            and this can cause ClassCircularityErrors. <b>So make sure that you have this one configured</b>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.exclude</td>
        <td>semicolon separated list of packages to
            include. E.g. com.yourcompany.;. Default a lot of packages are excluded
            to prevent problems. See the output of the Multiverse Javaagent for a listing. Excludes
            outrank includes.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-Dorg.multiverse.javaagent.instrumentor</td>
        <td>
            The org.multiverse.instrumentation.Instrumentor to use. The same Multiverse Javaagent
            can be used for different types of instrumentation. Using this property, the exact instrumentor
            is selected. Defaults to org.multiverse.stm.alpha.instrumentation.AlphaStmInstrumentor.
        </td>
    </tr>
