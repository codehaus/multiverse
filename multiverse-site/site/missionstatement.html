<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Reduce complexity of concurrency control where applicable by replacing lock based technology
        with transaction based. The goal is not to replace traditional concurrency control completely,
        but to provide an alternative programming model. I see Multiverse as filling the gap between
        traditional databases and traditional concurrency control.
    </li>
    <li>
        Seamless integration in the Java Language. In most cases this can be done through annotations
        in combination with instrumentation. So you don't need to extend any classes, implement interfaces
        impose limitations on the type of fields, or otherwise damage your oo design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a STM implementation that doesn't rely on the Java Language, but can be integrated in
        other Java based languages like Scala or Groovy as well. The STM implementation itself
        doesn't care about the language used, it only cares about classes implementing certain
        interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a good performing and scalable implementation to be useful in very demanding
        production environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a framework for experimenting with different STM implementations. It should be easy to
        swap implementations.
    </li>
</ol>
