<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Reduce complexity of concurrency control where applicable by replacing lock based technology
        with transaction based.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make seamless integrates in the Java Language possible using annotations where fitting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a STM implementation that doesn't rely on the Java Language, but can be integrated in
        other Java based languages like Scala or Groovy as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a good performing and scalable implementation to be useful in very demanding production environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide sufficient features and configuration options so that it is easy to optimize
        for speed or correctness.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a framework for experimenting with different STM implementations. It should be easy to
        swap implementation but preventing the need to do a lot of code alterations.
    </li>
</ol>
