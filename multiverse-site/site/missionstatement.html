<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Reduce complexity of concurrency control</b> where applicable by raising the abstraction level. The goal
        is not to replace traditional concurrency control completely, but to provide an alternative programming
        model. I see Multiverse as filling the gap between traditional databases and traditional concurrency
        control. In the future, extensions for durability and clustering are expected.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Seamless integration in the Java Language</b>. In most cases this can be done through annotations
        in combination with instrumentation. So you don't need to extend any classes, implement interfaces
        impose limitations on the type of fields, or otherwise damage your oo design.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>To be integrated in other JVM based languages</b> like Scala, Groovy or JRuby. The STM implementation
        itself doesn't care about the language used, it only cares about classes implementing certain
        interfaces. So it should be possible to combine transactional objects written in different
        languages, in the same STM.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Production environment quality.</b> Multiverse is not an academic experiment. The goal is
        to create a product that can be used in the most demanding production environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Provide a framework for STM experiments.</b> It should be easy to swap/tune the STM implementation
        without changing everything.
    </li>
</ol>
