        <para>After almost a year of hard and backbreaking work, Multiverse 0.7 was finally released. It is a complete
            rewrite from the previous releases where a lot of effort was made on removing some fundamental problems with
            the 0.6 design (the need for a shared clock was reduced considerable), so it should be a lot better scalable.
            Also the performance was increased considerably, and last but not least a whole new set of new features are added
            like commuting operations, pessimistic locking etc.
