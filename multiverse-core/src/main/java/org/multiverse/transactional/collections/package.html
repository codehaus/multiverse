This package contains datastructures like queues and maps written to be used in
STM transactions. The idea is to provide transactional implementations of the java
collection framework interfaces. Also an additional interface is introduced for
transactional collections that extend the original one. Using this transactional
interface instead of the original one clearly indicates to a developer that an object
of this type is transactional. Another advantage is that the instrumentation is able
to do a instrumentation improvements.
<p>
    Since Multiverse 0.5 it is possible to add annotations on interfaces so that they are
    used at the implementation. This is one of the things I normally hate with annotations
    because they don't inherit; well in Multiverse they do. A practical example of this ugly ness
    is the transaction support in Spring where you need to define the transaction settings on
    the implementation instead of the interface.
