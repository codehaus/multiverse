/**
 * Multiverse uses a speculative configuration mechanism if enabled makes certain optimizations possible. E.g. one of the optimizations
 * is to use different {@link org.multiverse.api.Transaction} implementations that are optimized for certain transaction lengths. As
 * long as the speculation is not violated, you will get better performance than when a more heavy weight transaction/configuration.
 *
 * <p>So ControlFlowErrors are not something bad, but just a way for the STM to figure out what the cheapest settings are for
 * performance/scalability.
 *
 * <h3>Unexpected retries</h3>
 *
 * <p>Because a transaction can fail on a speculative failure more than once, it could be that the transaction is retried. Normally
 * this is not an issue, since the transaction will be retried, so is invisible. And once the {@link org.multiverse.api.AtomicBlock}
 * has learned, it will not make the same mistakes again, but if you do io (e.g. print to the System.out or do logging) you can expect
 * to see aborts, even though there is no other reason to.
 *
 * Speculative behavior can be turned of (either on the Transaction or STM level) but you will not get the best out of performance. For
 * the speculative behavior to learn, it is important that the {@link org.multiverse.api.AtomicBlock} is reused.
