 * contending Transactions some time to complete so that the chance increases that the failing Transaction
 * can complete at a next attempt.
 *
 * Of course when there is a lot of contention, the BackoffPolicy isn't going to help and the Transaction
 * could start to suffer from a livelock/starvation.
