ideas:

- fast 'write' on orec.depart when exclusive lock and no surplus

- fast readset validation on committing transaction if the conflict counter has not changed
needs more research.

- stripe of conflict counters.

- optimize the tx-pool logic (instead of using an array, use a single linked list)..
transactions can also act as node (no need to introduce additional datastructures).

- Collections

    - 'size' structure to help with an approximate size for collections

- instead of going through the transaction to deal with tranlocals, one you have a reference to one,
all operations like openForWrite/checkConflict/ensure etc.

- ensure on the transaction? To make all changes 'committable'.

- selective notifies in transaction, instead of always waking up.. one could provide a function that only wakes
 up under certain conditions.

- actor atomic block, doesn't look at an existing transaction. Automatically exposes the onAbort/onCommit

- on read/ on write function
    - stuff like encryption and security could be added through this general purpose mechanism

- reset the speculative stuff once and a while.

- some spinning is allowed for the read conflict scan:
    is this desirable? If it is locked, chances are high that and update already is done or is going
    to be done.

- cheap writeskew detection; first lock all writes.. if conflict counter hasn't changed, you know that
there are no read conflicts..

- write validation: can it be optimized? If the conflict counter has not changed, you know that no other
transaction has caused any conflicting writes. So you know that there is no write conflict.

- when a transaction needs to wait for a lock, can it help another transaction?

- contention management.

- the class index makes it easy to create some kind of arrays that store all kind of information
  on the transactional class level. The question is how to to do it for transactions. You don't want to
  publish it every time.

- is it possible to combine pessimistic locking with blocking? What if a transaction wants to wait for a lock
to become free... so can when a lock unlease is done, see if there are listeners before releasing the lock? If
done before, the transaction knows it can remove the current listeners with the a cas, and add them to the set
of listeners that to be notified. If a transaction wants to block ...
when a normal transaction... when a lock is acquired, a retry error should also be thrown.

- durability:
    only when committing, a dirty transactional object needs to be checked if it is durable. If it isn't
    no unitofwrite needs to be used. If it is, a unit of write needs to be used. So the commit needs to

- create an orec that never become readbiased (useful for performance comparison).

- transactional treemap

- transactional treeset

- a reference that always causes a privatization.

- transactional array

- use a retry policy for re-acquiring lock. atm only spinning is used.

- cram all logic of the tranlocal in a long

- tryEnsure

- tryPrivatize

- tryEnsureWhen

- tryPrivatizeWhen

- reading and backoff? Atm only spinning is used.

- acquire commit lock. atm only some spinning is used

- clojure: add watch. Basic functionality already is there, but atm it is done to all
     reads and not specific ones.

- commute: commuting functions are executed in reverse order.

- blocking and speculative readtracking?

- lean mono should not upgrade to array when untracked read is done, but should just attach it to the transaction.

- rollbackfor/rollnotbackfor exception configuration

- automatic publication of javadoc on codehaus

- profiler

- full transactional objects

    - logic for full transactional objects needs to be fixed.

    - pooling for generic transactional object tranlocals.

- jmm issue with commit and listeners, it could happen that a write is done after a check is done if a listeners
  is available. This could lead to a deadlock since the listener that is set after the write
